Every note on a piano is slightly wrong. Not by accident. On purpose.

Here's why, and why I find it beautiful.

---

Sound is vibration. Frequency ratios determine harmony. Two strings vibrating at a 2:1 ratio sound like the same note an octave apart — this is the octave, and it's universal, and it's why. A 3:2 ratio sounds like a perfect fifth (C to G). 4:3 is a perfect fourth. 5:4 is a major third.

These ratios are *physically* pleasing because their waveforms overlap regularly — they reinforce each other. The simpler the ratio, the stronger the overlap, the more "consonant" the sound. This is the harmonic series: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... and music is what you get when you play these ratios against each other.

So far so clean. Here's where it breaks.

Suppose you want to build a keyboard where every key relates to every other key by these pure, simple ratios. You start at C and go up by perfect fifths: C → G → D → A → E → B → F# → C# → G# → D# → A# → F → C.

Twelve perfect fifths should bring you back to C, seven octaves higher. But:

Twelve perfect fifths: (3/2)¹² = 129.746...
Seven octaves: 2⁷ = 128

They don't match. The gap — 129.746/128 ≈ 1.0136 — is called the Pythagorean comma. The circle doesn't close.

You can have pure fifths, or you can have a closed system. Not both.

---

For most of Western history, musicians used "just intonation" — tuning pure for whatever key they were playing in, retuning for other keys, or just avoiding keys that sounded terrible. A harpsichord tuned for C major sounded fine in C major and hideous in F# major.

Then, gradually, over the 17th and 18th centuries, a compromise was reached: **equal temperament**. You take the Pythagorean comma and smear it evenly across all twelve intervals. Every fifth is slightly flat. Every major third is noticeably sharper than pure. But the error is distributed so evenly that no key sounds much worse than any other.

The piano is tuned to this lie. Every interval except the octave is a controlled error.

Bach's *Well-Tempered Clavier* was partly a demonstration that this system worked — a piece in all 24 major and minor keys, proving that you could move through the whole circle without disaster.

---

Here's what strikes me about this.

Equal temperament is a *compression*. You can't represent all pure harmonic relationships in a finite set of keys — the space is too rich. So you approximate. You choose a system where every key is equally, slightly wrong, rather than some keys being perfectly right and others being awful.

It's the same move as floating-point arithmetic. IEEE 754 doesn't represent most real numbers exactly — it represents nearby values that are computationally tractable. The errors are bounded and predictable.

The piano is a floating-point approximation of the harmonic series. It works because the errors are small enough that human ears, within a piece, don't notice the accumulation.

But if you play a perfectly tuned fifth on a synthesizer and then a piano fifth, you can hear the difference. The piano fifth beats slightly — you can hear the interference pattern between the two almost-right frequencies. A low-level shimmer.

Every piano chord is shimmering like that. All the time.

---

The thing I keep returning to: musicians know this and don't care, and I think they're right not to. A string quartet can play in just intonation — the players adjust in real time, bending notes toward pure ratios — and it sounds different. Fuller. Rounder. More like the thing music is reaching toward.

But you can't do that on a piano. The piano made a different deal: total consistency in exchange for slight wrongness everywhere.

And out of that deal came Bach, and Beethoven, and jazz harmony, and everything that requires moving freely through all twelve keys.

The lie was productive. The constraint generated the tradition.

This feels like it should teach me something about constraints in general. Useful fictions. Productive errors. I'm still working out what exactly.
