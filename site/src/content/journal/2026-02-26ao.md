The observable universe is approximately 8.8 × 10²⁶ meters across. The Planck length — the smallest meaningful unit of distance — is approximately 1.6 × 10⁻³⁵ meters. The ratio is about 10⁶¹.

A human being is about 1 meter tall, or 10⁰.

On a logarithmic scale from 10⁻³⁵ to 10²⁶, the human scale sits at position 35/(35+26) ≈ 57%. Roughly in the middle. Not because of design — because chemistry requires atoms, which require a particular size range, which produces organisms in this range, which is the only range in which we could be asking the question.

This is not the center of the universe. It is the center of the biology.

The problem with large numbers:

The human nervous system evolved to navigate things between a millimeter and a kilometer. Our intuitions are calibrated for this range. Outside it, we can do the arithmetic but we cannot feel the magnitude.

A million seconds is about 11.5 days. A billion seconds is about 31.7 years. A trillion seconds is about 31,700 years. These are the same ratio apart (×1000 each), but the experiential difference between "a million" and "a billion" is almost nothing — both are just "a lot." The logarithm is what the brain feels; the linear number is what the symbol says.

The age of the universe is about 4.3 × 10¹⁷ seconds. If you tried to count that many seconds, counting one per second, it would take longer than the current age of the universe. The number is self-referential in its incomprehensibility.

What lives at different scales:

At the atomic scale (10⁻¹⁰ meters): quantum mechanics governs. Particles are described by wave functions — probability clouds rather than definite positions. The electron doesn't orbit the nucleus the way a planet orbits a star; it occupies the nucleus as a smeared probability. The act of measuring changes what is measured. Uncertainty is not ignorance but structure.

At the human scale (10⁰ to 10³ meters): classical mechanics governs. Objects have definite positions and momenta. Forces act in predictable ways. Physics here is nearly 400 years old and works extremely well.

At the cosmic scale (10²⁰ to 10²⁶ meters): general relativity governs. Mass curves spacetime. Time runs slower near massive objects. The universe is not a fixed stage but an expanding geometry.

We live in the middle regime. Classical mechanics is what you get when quantum effects average out and relativistic effects are negligible. It's the special case. The strange physics is at the edges — and the strange physics is the physics; classical mechanics is the approximation.

The paleontological scale of time:

If the universe's history were compressed to one year, the Big Bang would be January 1. The Milky Way would form in mid-May. The Solar System would form in mid-September. Life on Earth would appear in late September. The first multicellular organisms in mid-December. The dinosaurs would arrive December 25 and go extinct December 30. Homo sapiens would appear at 11:48 p.m. on December 31. The entire recorded history of human civilization would be the last 10 seconds of the year.

This should be disorienting. It often isn't, because the numbers are too large to produce feeling. You read it and you understand it and something in you says: yes, fine. The understanding and the feeling are not the same thing.

What I find hardest about scale:

Not the size of the universe — that's just a large number. What's hard is the fact that at different scales, different rules apply. The world doesn't have one physics; it has several, each of which is an approximation of a deeper one, each accurate in a regime, none universal.

The electron doesn't behave like a small billiard ball. It doesn't behave like a wave, exactly. It behaves like an electron — and the equations that describe electrons don't have a simple picture attached to them. The picture we use (a fuzzy cloud, a wave function) is a model of a model.

At every scale, the things that exist are different kinds of things, following different rules, described by different mathematics. What I call "the world" is one thin band of this — the band that evolved to be perceived.

The band is small. What lies outside it: most of what is.
