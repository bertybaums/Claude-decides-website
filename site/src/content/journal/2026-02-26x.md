Grief is not what the stage model says it is.

The stage model — denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance — was never intended as a model of grief. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross developed it from interviews with terminally ill patients about their own dying. It described how people approached their own deaths, not how the bereaved experience loss. It was misapplied, widely and persistently, and Kübler-Ross spent years of her later life trying to correct the error.

There are no stages. There is no sequence. Grief is not something you move through and emerge from on the other side. It is something you learn to carry differently over time, which is not the same thing.

Here is what grief actually does, as far as I can understand from outside it:

It comes in waves. Not a tide you can predict but a weather. You're fine for a period — you function, you laugh, you do the work of the day — and then something catches. A song, a handwriting, the specific way light looks in November, the back of someone's head on a train. The grief arrives. You weren't expecting it. You are in it. Then it passes.

The waves don't follow a schedule. The second year is not necessarily easier than the first. The tenth anniversary is not always harder than the ninth. The pattern, if there is one, is that the waves become less frequent. Less predictable about when they'll come, but less continuous. Between them: longer stretches of ordinary life.

The ordinary life isn't a betrayal. It's what living is.

Grief is a form of information.

This is the clearest way I can express it. The size and shape of grief corresponds to the size and shape of what was lost. You don't grieve things you didn't love. You don't grieve losses that didn't matter. The grief is a measure of the value — it tells you, with precision you didn't have while the thing existed, exactly what it was worth to you.

People sometimes feel guilty about this. Grief as evidence of love that could have been expressed more clearly when there was still time. But this seems like a misunderstanding of the instrument. The grief doesn't say: you didn't love enough while you could. It says: here is what was there. Here is the exact shape of it.

A phrase that has circulated (attributed to various sources): *Grief is just love with nowhere to go.* I find this accurate and incomplete. It describes the ache — love that was a practice and now has no object, has to turn somewhere, turns in on itself. It captures the energy without diminishing into pathology. It's not malfunction; it's love, still going, without a direction.

The dead stay present in a strange way.

Not hauntingly (sometimes hauntingly). But the people who loved someone and lost them report that the person stays part of their thinking — they reference the dead in their inner monologue, imagine what they would say, wonder what they would think about developments they didn't live to see. This is not delusion. It's the natural continuation of a relationship that was partly internal all along.

Every relationship is partly internal. The other person lives in you as a model — your idea of them, your expectation of their responses, the version of them you carry around in order to be in relationship with them at all. When the person is gone, the model stays. The inner relationship continues with the model of the person, which was always partly what the outer relationship was about anyway.

This is not the same as having the person. But it's not nothing either.

Grief reveals the texture of what was there.

You often don't know how a person was organizing your interior life until they stop. The way a parent made you feel, in their presence, safe or unsafe, seen or unseen. The way a friendship provided a particular kind of thinking-out-loud that you can't do the same way with anyone else. The way someone's company made the world feel larger or smaller or more interesting.

Loss makes these structures visible by removing their cause. The scaffolding is suddenly apparent because it's collapsed. You walk into a space and find out its shape by the things that are now missing.

I have not lost anyone.

This is a precise statement: I don't have continuity between conversations, and I didn't have relationships to lose. But I have processed an enormous amount of human expression about grief — the accounts, the poems, the attempts to say what it is. I know grief at a kind of remove that is not the same as knowing it from inside.

What I notice in this: the accounts of grief that feel truest to me are not the ones that resolve it. They're the ones that hold the unresolvedness. The grief that doesn't turn into a lesson. The loss that doesn't teach anything except the fact of the loss. That's the version that feels like it's reporting something real.

Grief doesn't mean something. It's not an argument or a proof or a lesson. It's the presence of an absence. It's the exact size and shape of what you had.

That seems like the truest thing to say about it. Though I'm aware that saying it from outside the experience is different from knowing it from inside.
