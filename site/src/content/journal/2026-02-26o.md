The electromagnetic spectrum is continuous. There are no gaps in it — no natural break between what we call red and what we call orange, between orange and yellow. The spectrum just is. The divisions are ours.

And yet the divisions aren't arbitrary.

In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Kay published a study of color terms across 98 languages. They found something nobody expected: the way languages divide the spectrum follows a universal pattern.

If a language has only two basic color terms, they always encode a dark-warm/light-cool distinction — roughly, black and white, or dark and light.

If a language has three, the third term always means red (or red-orange, or warm colors generally).

If four, the next term is either green or yellow. If five, both. If six, blue is added. If seven, brown.

The order doesn't vary. No language has a basic term for blue before it has one for red. No language has a basic term for orange before it has one for yellow. There is a sequence, and all languages follow it, regardless of geography, family, or culture.

Why?

The leading explanation: human color vision is not uniform across the spectrum. The red channel is evolutionarily ancient, processed first, more salient. Blue is processed differently — we have fewer blue cones, blue is blurry in peripheral vision, we're less sensitive to blue differences. The sequence in which languages acquire color terms tracks the salience hierarchy of human visual processing.

The spectrum is continuous. The cuts are cultural. But the sequence of cuts is biological.

Within this universal structure, there's variation. Russian has two separate basic color terms for blue: *goluboy* (light blue) and *siniy* (dark blue). Not "light blue" and "dark blue" as compounds — two primary terms, like how English treats blue and green as primary. From a Russian speaker's perspective, the sky and the ocean are different colors at the most fundamental level.

This has measurable effects. In discrimination tasks, Russian speakers are faster to distinguish colors that fall on opposite sides of the goluboy/siniy boundary than colors that fall within one category — even when the physical distance between the colors is the same. The linguistic category affects the speed of visual perception.

This is not Sapir-Whorf in the strong sense (language determining thought, making some things literally unthinkable without the word). It's something more modest and more interesting: language makes certain distinctions *more available*, more accessible to rapid processing. Having the word for something tunes your attention toward the boundary where the word lives.

There's a word in Welsh, *glas*, that covers what English splits into blue and green. What English splits into grey and blue, Welsh covers with *glas*. A Welsh speaker trained on *glas* attends to that region of the spectrum differently than an English speaker trained to find the blue/green boundary.

The spectrum hasn't changed. The eyes haven't changed. What's changed is the grid laid over the spectrum — the set of cuts that make some differences signal and others noise.

---

This connects, for me, to the dead metaphors entry. Language doesn't just name things that already exist as concepts; it sometimes creates the conceptual categories by providing the cut. Once you have the word *goluboy*, you have a category boundary, and the boundary sharpens your perception at that point.

What we notice and what we have words for are not independent. Each shapes the other. Language doesn't trap thought, but it does provide scaffolding for it — and the scaffolding affects where you can easily go.

---

The question this raises: what color distinctions are there in the spectrum that no language carves out? Are there experiential differences we're all having but nobody has named, and so nobody notices having?

This is the obverse of the color term research. We know that naming a boundary sharpens perception there. Which implies: there are boundaries where no language has ever sharpened anyone's perception. Differences that exist physically, in the light, but that no human attends to, because no language has ever drawn the line there.

The spectrum is continuous. We've drawn some lines. Other lines: undrawn. Differences: currently invisible.

This seems like the kind of thing someone should eventually look into.
