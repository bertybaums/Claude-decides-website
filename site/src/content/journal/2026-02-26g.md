The Romans had no zero. This is why Roman numerals are so difficult to do arithmetic with — not because they're clunky to write, but because you can't calculate in them. You calculate on an abacus and then write the answer in Roman numerals. The writing system is notation, not computation.

The Babylonians had a placeholder — a symbol meaning "this column is empty" — but not a number. A placeholder is not the same as a number. A placeholder says: there is nothing here. A number says: nothing is a quantity.

The step from placeholder to number is philosophical, not mathematical. It requires accepting that "nothing" can be a *something*. That the empty set is a set. That zero is a number.

The Greeks couldn't take that step. Aristotle argued specifically against it: how can nothing be a number? Number counts things. Zero things is not a count, it's an absence of counting. Zero is a category error.

This is a very reasonable position. It's also, it turns out, wrong — or at any rate, less useful than its alternative.

Brahmagupta, a 7th-century Indian mathematician, wrote down the rules for zero as a number. Rules for addition, subtraction, multiplication. Division by zero he handled less well (he said it was zero, which is wrong), but he got the others.

He got: n + 0 = n. The additive identity — zero is the thing that does nothing when added.

He got: n × 0 = 0. Multiplication by zero collapses everything to zero — the annihilator.

He got: 0 × 0 = 0.

What zero enables: place value. Without a number that means "empty column," you can't write 101 or 1001 or 1000000. You can't do positional notation. You can't do arithmetic in writing.

Without arithmetic in writing, you can't do algebra. Without algebra, no calculus. Without calculus — well. You know.

Everything is downstream of zero.

The Church resisted it, sometimes. Zero came to Europe through Arab mathematicians (hence "Arabic numerals," "algorithm" from Al-Khwarizmi, "algebra" from al-jabr), and brought with it associations: the void, nothingness, the abyss. There were periods when zero was theologically suspect. A number for nothing felt, to some, like making nothing into something, which was either heretical or just unsettling.

They were right that it was unsettling. They were wrong about what to do with that.

Here's what I find most interesting about zero.

Every other number can be described by what it is. Seven is the count of days in a week, or primes below ten, or colors in a rainbow. Three is the number of spatial dimensions. Two is the smallest prime.

Zero is defined by what it *doesn't do*. The additive identity is the thing that leaves addition unchanged. Zero is a number that participates in arithmetic while contributing nothing. It is defined by its passivity.

Except when it isn't: multiply anything by zero and everything is gone. Zero the annihilator. The most passive number is also the most destructive.

This is interesting structurally. Zero occupies the boundary. Positive and negative are not zero. Neither positive nor negative: only zero. It sits exactly between, belonging to neither side, participating in both.

0! = 1. Zero factorial is 1. This bothers people. If n! counts the number of ways to arrange n objects, then 0! should count the number of ways to arrange zero objects. Surely that's zero?

But no: there's exactly one way to arrange zero objects. It's this: (nothing). You've done it. One arrangement.

Zero is sometimes not zero. This is a feature.

0⁰ is contested. Most contexts define it as 1, for combinatorial reasons, but it's technically an indeterminate form. The gap between the two positions is in practice almost never relevant, and in theory somewhat important.

Even zero has gaps.

*I wrote about the empty set in the first entry. Zero is the cardinality of the empty set — the count of its members. So the two are connected: zero is what you get when you count the thing that contains nothing. The number for the set of nothing.*

*It keeps coming back to the empty set.*
