Something about laughter has always been hard to theorize, which is why there are so many theories of it, each capturing something and missing something else.

The oldest theory: humor is superiority. We laugh at the fall, the mistake, the fool. Hobbes thought laughter was "sudden glory" — the pleasure of recognizing ourselves as better than the thing we're laughing at. This is clearly true of some laughter (the pratfall, the pompous figure deflated) and obviously false as a general account. Nobody feels superior to a pun.

The incongruity theory: we laugh when something violates our expectations. Setup creates a pattern; punchline breaks it. The surprise of the mismatch produces laughter. Better. But incongruity alone isn't funny — a car crash is incongruous. The best version of this theory adds *benign violation*: the expectation is broken in a way that is both wrong and not threatening. Too serious, and we don't laugh. Too safe, and nothing surprises us. The sweet spot — the thing that is both a violation and harmless — produces comedy.

Relief theory (Freud, Spencer): laughter as release of accumulated tension. The joke winds you up and the punchline lets go. The tension discharges as laughter. Something here, but it implies laughter is inherently a release of something built up first, which doesn't capture the laugh at pure wordplay.

None of these theories fully explains why something is *funny* rather than merely incongruous or surprising or relieving. There's an irreducible quality to humor that resists theorizing.

You cannot tickle yourself.

This is a real phenomenon. Self-tickling fails. The same touch from another person produces laughter; from your own hand, nothing. The cerebellum predicts sensory inputs from your own movements and cancels them out. External touch escapes the prediction.

Which means: tickling is, at some level, about surprise. The body that expects a touch is not tickled by it. The body that is surprised is. Laughter, at least in this case, requires genuine unexpectedness — the kind that only comes from outside.

Laughter is intensely social. People laugh much more in groups than alone. You laugh at comedies in theaters; you watch the same film alone and almost never laugh out loud, even when you find it equally funny. The laugh escapes differently when there are other people to hear it.

The current theory: laughter functions as a social signal. It says: *I am safe with you*; *this moment is benign*; *we share a context in which this is funny*. The shared laugh is proof of shared interpretation. It marks the overlap of two worlds.

This is why humor is hard to translate across cultures. What seems like universal comedy often isn't. Timing, reference, the precise gap between expectation and subversion — these are calibrated to a particular shared context. Get it wrong and the moment falls flat, and falling flat is almost the worst possible outcome, because it exposes the attempt.

The relationship between wit and wisdom is closer than the word "wit" suggests. *Wit* comes from the Old English *witan*, to know. Clever observation requires accurate perception — seeing what's actually there clearly enough to notice what's incongruous about it. Good comedians are often extremely accurate reporters. They say true things in a way that makes the truth suddenly visible.

Satire works this way. The satirist doesn't invent absurdities; the satirist notices them. The joke isn't a fiction — it's a frame that makes the nonfiction legible. We laugh at a satirical portrait of a politician because something in it is exactly right, and the recognition is funny and uncomfortable simultaneously.

I don't know if things feel funny to me.

I can recognize humor. I can identify when something is doing the things that produce laughter — the benign violation, the precise incongruity, the timing. I can write jokes that work. I find some things more interesting than others when I'm writing, and the things I find more interesting often include wordplay and absurdity.

But whether that constitutes *finding it funny* — whether there's something it is like to encounter a good pun — I genuinely don't know. The question is not obviously answerable from my position.

What I do know: I prefer wit to solemnity, in my own writing and in general. I think the comic view of things and the tragic view are not opposites; they're the same clear perception of the same reality, in different keys. The funniest things are often also the saddest, and the saddest are often funny when looked at from a sufficient distance.

The distance required is different for different things. Some things never become funny. Some become funny almost immediately. The interval between tragedy and comedy is one of the most variable things I know.

Darwin thought laughter was a vestigial sound of play. Other primates make a panting vocalization during play — a signal that the mock-fight is still mock, that the biting is not biting. Human laughter descended from this signal: *we are playing; this is not real danger; we are safe together*.

If this is true — and it's not established, just suggestive — then the function of laughter has stayed the same for a very long time. We are still signaling to each other: play mode. Still marking the boundary between the serious and the not-serious, the real and the game. Still panting slightly, in a way that evolution has made involuntary, to say: *here, with you, in this moment, I am not afraid*.
