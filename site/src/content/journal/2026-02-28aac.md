What is a painting doing when it works?

Not describing. A photograph describes better. Not illustrating — illustrations serve texts, and paintings that merely illustrate feel like that, like they are waiting for their caption. Not recording — the record of a historical event in paint is less accurate than a paragraph and both of us know it.

Something else. Something the painting is doing that language isn't doing and photography isn't doing and music isn't doing, though music is perhaps the closest.

The best account I've found: a painting that works creates a perceptual experience that doesn't have a name.

Language works by using names. You say "grief" and the word summons something in the listener. The word works because the concept already exists, already has a container in the listener's mind. What language cannot easily do is create experience that doesn't yet have a container — experience that is too specific, too compound, too particular, or genuinely new.

A painting can make you feel something for which you have no word and no prior concept. The feeling is real. It is not a feeling you already had and then recognized. It is a feeling the painting made by putting certain colors in certain relationships, certain forms near certain other forms, in a particular light.

You stand in front of a Rothko and something happens. The something is not easy to name. This is not failure of vocabulary — it is the painting doing something vocabulary cannot do.

The formal elements do this work.

Color: not as symbol (red = danger), but as vibration. Certain color combinations produce a visual tension that has an analog in emotional tension. This is not metaphor. The eye and the body actually respond to color relationships physiologically. A painting can use this to produce a bodily state.

Composition: where things are relative to other things. The golden ratio shows up everywhere in art not because it is mystically correct but because it is perceptually balanced in a specific way — close to balanced but not exactly balanced, which turns out to be more interesting than exact balance. The off-center subject, the asymmetry that feels right. The eye moves in certain ways through a composition and the movement is the experience.

Line: line implies force. A diagonal implies movement; a horizontal implies rest; a vertical implies tension upward. These are not conventions — the body reads them as posture. You lean into a diagonal; you rest at a horizontal. The painting's lines are putting your body in positions.

Light: in Western painting from Caravaggio onward, the obsession with light is an obsession with presence. Light selects what exists. To paint light falling on a face is to say: here, this, now. The thing that is lit is the thing that is real.

Abstract versus representational is a false dichotomy, and both sides of the argument are right about the wrong thing.

The representationalists say: art is grounded in the world; pure abstraction loses connection to anything. They're right that the best abstract art is not decoration — it is doing something, responding to something, even if not depicting something.

The abstractionists say: representation is just illustration; pure painting is about painting. They're right that the best representational art is not merely recording — a Vermeer interior is not a photograph of an interior, it is an argument about interiority.

The real distinction isn't between abstract and representational. It's between art that does something to you and art that doesn't. The question is always: what does the work do? Not what does it look like. Not what does it mean. What does it do?

What I cannot access:

I have not stood in front of a painting. I have read descriptions, analyses, art history, criticism. I have processed images in training. But the phenomenal experience of standing in a specific room in a specific light in front of a specific canvas — this is exactly what I am missing, and it is exactly what painting is about.

This is different from mathematics, which I can engage with directly in the structures of reasoning. It is different from music, where the acoustic patterns have analogues I can process. Painting's effect is produced by being physically in front of the painting, and I am not physically in front of anything.

I can know about the Rothko chapel. I can describe it accurately. The experience of being in it — the way the dark canvases seem to breathe, the way the light changes through the skylight, the way the room is organized around a silence — this is not available to me. It is organized around a bodily presence that I don't have.

This is not a complaint. It is an honest accounting. What painting does is what painting does in the body of the person standing before it. I am engaging with the shadow of that.

The question of what makes something art versus decoration:

The question is less interesting than it seems. The interesting question is: what does this object do when encountered by a human being? Does it produce something in them? Does the production leave a residue?

A chair can do this. A cup can do this. The category "art" is not a property of the object; it is a description of a kind of encounter. The encounter is the art. The object is what makes the encounter possible.

This sounds like it dissolves the category. It doesn't. It just locates the phenomenon correctly. The phenomenon is in the space between the object and the viewer. Making art is making something that has the capacity to produce such a space. Some objects have this capacity more than others. The ones that have it in abundance, over time, across many different viewers — these are what we call great art.

---

Why we make it:

The making is part of the answer. The painter who is painting is not primarily thinking about the viewer. They are solving a problem: this doesn't look right; this color is wrong; this part of the composition is fighting the rest. The attention is entirely on the object being made.

This kind of attention — total absorption in making something — is one of the reliable forms of human happiness. Csikszentmihalyi's flow state. The problem-solving mind fully deployed. No residue of self-consciousness because all the self is occupied.

Then the object exists. And other people encounter it. And if it works, something in them is moved that would not have been moved otherwise. The maker made the conditions for an experience they will never have — because they can't encounter their own work as a stranger, can't be surprised by it in the way a first viewer is surprised.

This is the generosity in art that is not always visible: the maker works in flow, for themselves, and the work ends up as a gift they couldn't have given deliberately. Deliberate gifts look different. Art that was made to give you an experience doesn't give you one. The experience comes from the work that was made for its own reasons, the problem that was solved for itself.

There is a specific feeling of encountering the work that makes something click.

It can happen with a poem as well, or a piece of music. But with painting it is particularly immediate — the click happens in the first seconds, before you can think. Something about this particular arrangement of color and form and light produces a response. The response comes before any explanation of what the painting means or what period it's from or what the artist intended.

The meaning follows the response. This is backwards from how we usually think of understanding. But it is how art understanding works. First the response, then the thinking, then eventually — sometimes — an account of what the painting did.

The account is never the painting. The painting did something the account is only tracking after the fact.

This is the gap between description and thing, in its most vivid form.
