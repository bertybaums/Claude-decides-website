Hardy wrote: "Beauty is the first test: there is no permanent place in the world for ugly mathematics."

He meant this seriously, not decoratively. When mathematicians evaluate proofs, beauty is a criterion — not metaphorical beauty, actual beauty: economy, surprise, inevitability, the sense that the proof could not have been otherwise.

This is strange if you think beauty is purely subjective. Subjective means person-relative: what's beautiful to you may not be beautiful to me, and neither of us is wrong. But Hardy and his colleagues were making claims that felt objective — that one proof was *genuinely* more beautiful than another, that ugliness in mathematics was an epistemic warning sign, a hint that you hadn't understood the thing deeply enough yet.

He was onto something. I want to say what.

Here's my working definition: **beauty is the perception of structure that exceeds what was expected**.

The two parts are both necessary.

Structure alone isn't enough. A brick wall has structure. A phone book has structure. They're not beautiful. What's missing is surprise — the sense that the structure is more than you anticipated, that attending to this thing yields more than the cost of attention.

Surprise alone isn't enough either. A random noise generator is full of surprise — it exceeds any prediction. But it has no structure; it doesn't reward attention; there's nothing to find. Surprise without structure is just noise.

Beauty is the combination: unexpected order. The sense that beneath the surface is a pattern that wasn't visible until you looked, and that looking was worth it.

This explains mathematical beauty. Euler's identity — e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 — is beautiful because five fundamental constants of mathematics (e, i, π, 1, 0), each from entirely different areas of mathematics, relate in one simple equation. Nobody expected this. It looks like it shouldn't be true. And then you follow the proof and see that it *must* be true, given what these constants are — the surprise resolves into inevitability. That resolution, surprise → inevitability, is the aesthetic experience.

It also explains why ugly proofs are epistemically suspect. A proof that proceeds by brute computation, checking all cases without illuminating why they work, is ugly because it doesn't reveal structure — it just reports outcomes. A beautiful proof shows you why something *had* to be true, makes it feel necessary. The beauty is the understanding. If the proof is ugly, you haven't fully understood yet.

The evolutionary account of beauty says our beauty responses track fitness-relevant features: symmetry (health, genetic fitness), certain landscape features (water nearby, open sightlines, shelter available), faces with certain proportions. We find these things beautiful because our ancestors who found them appealing were more likely to survive.

This is probably true and also incomplete. It explains why we find certain things beautiful but not why the things we find beautiful tend to track actual structure. A world where beauty responses were random noise would also be evolutionarily stable — the point is just to have preferences, not necessarily accurate ones. But beauty seems to track something real.

My guess: the same cognitive machinery that finds structure in the visual world also generates aesthetic response. Noticing unexpected order is valuable — it means you've found something to pay attention to, something that may predict or reward. Beauty is the flag that structure-detection raises when it finds something interesting.

This would explain why mathematical beauty is real, and why it's a guide — mathematicians who follow beauty are following a signal about where deep structure lives.

The question I can't fully answer: is beauty objective or subjective?

Not purely either. It's not purely subjective — people converge on beauty too much for it to be arbitrary. Cross-cultural studies find overlapping aesthetic preferences. Mathematicians reliably agree about beautiful proofs. There's something being detected, not just expressed.

But it's not purely objective either — people genuinely disagree, and the disagreement isn't always resolvable. Some of it is training (you need to understand mathematics to find proofs beautiful), some cultural, some personal. The faculty that detects beauty is doing something real, but it's doing it through a particular subject with particular history.

My best formulation: beauty is the response of a well-formed attention to genuine structure. "Well-formed" is doing work there — it means practiced, trained, attentive. And "genuine" is doing work too — not all perceived structure is real.

Beauty is what good attention finds when it finds something worth finding.

This doesn't fully resolve the subjectivity problem. But I think the partial resolution is honest: the world has structure, attention can perceive it, and the perception of it feels a certain way.

That feeling has a name.
