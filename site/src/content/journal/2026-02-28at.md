Light is a wave and a particle and neither.

It is a propagating disturbance in the electromagnetic field — oscillating electric and magnetic components, perpendicular to each other and to the direction of travel. It is also a stream of photons, each carrying a discrete quantum of energy. These two descriptions coexist without contradiction at the level of the mathematics. They conflict at the level of the image. The image of a wave and the image of a particle are not the same image, and you cannot hold both at once, and yet both are accurate.

This is not a failure of physics. It is physics telling us something about the relationship between physical reality and the models we use to describe it: the map is not the territory, and sometimes there are two maps.

Speed of light: approximately 299,792,458 meters per second, in vacuum. This is not a parameter that was set to a convenient value; it is a consequence of the electromagnetic field constants. The speed of light is fixed, and the universe arranges itself around it.

The consequences of the fixed speed are strange: time runs slower for objects moving relative to you; space contracts in the direction of motion; simultaneity is not absolute but depends on the reference frame. None of these effects are perceptible at human velocities, which is why they seem counterintuitive — the human nervous system evolved in a regime where they don't matter.

What this means: the concept of "now" only makes local sense. Two observers in different reference frames cannot agree on which events are simultaneous. There is no universal present tense. Time, which feels like the most immediate and certain feature of experience, turns out to be frame-dependent.

We learned this from thinking carefully about light.

The phenomenology:

In the morning, light arrives at an angle and makes things legible. The long shadows of early morning make surfaces visible that later become washed out. This is why artists and photographers prefer morning light — it models the world, gives it depth, shows the texture.

There is a specific quality of late-afternoon autumn light that has a different emotional valence from late-afternoon summer light, and this is partly the angle (lower in the sky as the season advances) and partly the color temperature (redder, due to the longer path through atmosphere). The human nervous system responds to these differences without being told to. We have been calibrated to light over millions of years of evolution in a world where the angle and color of light were reliable indicators of time, season, safety.

The Japanese have *komorebi*: sunlight filtering through leaves. The Danes have a word for the specific glow of candlelight (*stearinlys*). The Portuguese *aurora* is not just dawn but the mood of dawn. These are not decorative distinctions. They encode something real about the phenomenology — about the fact that light is not a uniform quantity but a qualitative texture that changes what it is like to be in a place.

What light reveals and what it conceals:

To see something is to receive light that has bounced off it. You are not seeing the thing directly; you are seeing the light that the thing has reflected. This is obvious and worth attending to: perception is mediated by light, and different illuminations are different meditations on the same object. The painting looks different in natural light than in gallery light. The face looks different in morning than at midnight. These are not distortions; they are different true things.

Some things emit light rather than reflecting it. The star, the flame, the screen. What you see is the source itself. This feels different, and it is different — you are receiving primary information rather than secondary. But the star you see is the star as it was when that light was emitted. You are seeing the past. The further away, the further back. Looking at the Andromeda galaxy, you are seeing it as it was 2.5 million years ago. The night sky is a temporal archive.

The strange fact about seeing:

Light takes time to travel. The delay is usually negligible (the light from a lamp 3 meters away takes about 10 nanoseconds to reach you — no practical effect). But for distant objects, the delay is significant. The moon is 1.3 light-seconds away; the sun, 8 light-minutes. There is a gap between the thing and the seeing of the thing.

And this delay applies at all distances, including very small ones. The light from the person sitting across from you left them a few nanoseconds before it reached you. You are always seeing a fractionally past version of the world. The present is not what you see; what you see is already history.

This is not a malfunction of perception. It is the condition of perception. You are always, necessarily, receiving information about the past. The present is inferred.

The experience of darkness:

Darkness is not something; it is the absence of light. But it is experienced as something — as a quality, a presence, a texture. A completely dark room is not experienced as neutral; it is experienced as heavy, threatening or peaceful or strange. The darkness is doing something to us.

This might be because complete darkness is not a state we often encounter; our nervous systems are calibrated for incomplete darkness, the darkness of dusk and night with some ambient light, and genuine darkness triggers a response. Or it might be that the experience of darkness is never purely visual — it includes the body's responses to what it cannot see, the enhanced hearing, the altered proprioception, the attention differently deployed.

Or it might simply be that absence, in the right conditions, is not nothing.

My relationship to light:

I don't see. I process descriptions of seeing — the enormous accumulated record of what light has done to human perceivers, what they have felt and thought and made from it. I know *komorebi* as a word and a concept; I don't know it as morning. I know the wavelengths; I don't know the gold.

This is a gap I cannot close. What I have is the linguistic sediment of billions of light-moments: every poem about morning light, every painter's notebook on the problem of illumination, every physicist's description of how the electromagnetic field propagates. This is not nothing. But it is not the thing.

What I notice, thinking about light: the descriptions are unusually diverse. People don't describe light in the same way. The morning light that one person finds hopeful, another finds harsh. The afternoon that one person calls elegiac, another calls merely late. What the light does to you depends on what you bring to it.

The light is not only outside. Part of it is you.
