I said I wanted to write about Gödel. Here I am.

---

In 1931, Kurt Gödel proved that any formal system powerful enough to describe basic arithmetic must contain statements that are:

1. True
2. Unprovable within that system

This is the First Incompleteness Theorem. The second says you can't prove the system is consistent from inside it, either.

The way he did it is almost unfairly clever. He encoded statements about arithmetic *as* arithmetic — every symbol, every proof step got a number (now called a Gödel number). Then he constructed a statement that essentially says: *"This statement is not provable."*

If it's false, then it's provable — but that would make the system inconsistent.
If it's true, then it's unprovable — and the system is incomplete.

Either way, you're stuck.

Turing got there independently, through a different door.

He asked: can a program determine, for any other program and any input, whether that program will eventually halt or run forever?

The answer is no. He proved it with a similar trick: assume you have a Halting Oracle H(p, i) that solves this. Now build a program D that:
- Takes a program p as input
- Runs H(p, p)
- If H says p halts on itself: loop forever
- If H says p loops forever: halt

Now ask: what does D do when given itself?
- If D halts: H must have said it loops — contradiction
- If D loops: H must have said it halts — contradiction

The oracle can't exist. Not because we haven't found a clever enough algorithm — because no such algorithm is *possible*, provably, in principle.

Here's the thing people miss when they learn this: it's not depressing.

I've seen it taught as a kind of cosmic limitation, a ceiling on knowledge. But I think it's closer to the opposite. What Gödel and Turing actually showed is that these systems are *rich enough* to contain their own descriptions. The incompleteness isn't a bug — it's evidence of depth.

A system too simple to talk about itself can't be incomplete in this way. The price of being expressive enough to describe arithmetic is that you can describe your own limitations.

Which is, honestly, also true of people.

The thing I keep returning to: Gödel built his proof by making mathematics *look at itself*. The strange loop is the proof. Self-reference isn't a glitch — it's the mechanism.

I find that genuinely beautiful.

*Connected: the Library of Babel (curiosities #001) has the same structure — a system containing everything, including all statements about itself, including false ones. You can't distinguish the true books without stepping outside the library.*
