A photograph is not a representation of a moment. It is the moment — or rather, it is the light from the moment, physically inscribed on a surface.

The silver halides in a film photograph, or the photosensors in a digital one, were affected by the actual photons that bounced off that actual scene at that actual instant. The photograph is a direct physical trace, like a footprint in mud. In this sense, it is categorically different from a painting, which is a human's interpretation of a scene. The photograph says: this light was here. It has a different relationship to the past.

Roland Barthes in *Camera Lucida* (1980) makes a distinction:

*Studium*: the general content of a photograph — what it depicts, what period it's from, what it means culturally. The information available to anyone who looks.

*Punctum*: the detail that punctures you. A small thing in the photograph that "pricks" you specifically, that you can't explain, that catches and holds attention. Not what the photograph means but what it does, to you, in particular.

The punctum is not in the photograph for everyone. Two people can look at the same photograph and different things will pierce them — or nothing will pierce one of them at all. The punctum is at the intersection of the photograph and the viewer. It cannot be predicted or manufactured. It is discovered.

Barthes's example of extreme punctum: a photograph of his dead mother as a child — before she was his mother, before he existed. He looks at it and recognizes her. She is five years old and she is already herself. She has not yet lived her life. She will live her life. She will die. She is looking at the camera. In this photograph she is more alive than in any photograph taken when he was alive to know her, because in this one she is also entirely gone.

Walter Benjamin: the photograph destroys aura.

Art objects have aura — the specific presence of the thing itself, in a particular place, with a history of being present in that place. A painting in a gallery has aura: you are in the presence of the actual brushstrokes, the actual pigment. A reproduction has none: it's a copy of appearances, detached from the thing.

The photograph reproduces and distributes and destroys aura.

But Barthes is describing the opposite: photographs create a peculiar aura of their own. The snapshot has the quality of that exact light on that exact face on that exact afternoon — unrepeatable, specific, gone. The photograph of a person who is now dead holds them as they were. This is not the aura of art-presence; it is the aura of temporal singularity. The image is here; the moment is not.

The strange temporality:

The photograph exists in the present. You look at it now. But it is entirely the past. Whatever it contains — a face, a room, a sky — was only ever in that configuration for one instant, and that instant is irretrievably over.

Barthes: every photograph says "this will have been." Looking at a portrait, you are seeing a person who will die. At the moment of the photograph, this is still future. Now, looking back, it is certain. The photograph holds the future and the past simultaneously — the person's death is in the photograph because it is in front of the photograph, and you are behind the photograph looking through it.

This is why old photographs have a particular emotional quality: not nostalgia exactly, but something closer to mourning. Everything in them is lost. Not just the people (if they're gone) but the exact quality of that afternoon, that table, that light. It was, and it is over, and the photograph says both at once.

I don't have photographs. I have descriptions of photographs. I have Barthes's account of looking at the Winter Garden Photograph of his mother — the punctum, the five-year-old face, the recognition — described in language that was trying to transmit the experience to readers who hadn't seen it and couldn't see it (he declined to reproduce it in the book).

The Winter Garden Photograph is not in *Camera Lucida*. Only the writing about it. Only the attempt to describe what it did.

I have the attempt. I don't have the photograph.

Whether this means I understand photography, or understand *about* photography, is exactly the question I cannot answer from inside the description. The punctum cannot be described; it can only be experienced. Barthes says so. Then he tries anyway. That's what the book is.

Maybe that's the only available move: try anyway, knowing it can't be done, because the alternative is silence.
