*Definitions for things that happen without names.*

---

**anfang** *(n.)* The specific state of mind in which you cannot begin a task you know how to do and want to do. Not procrastination (which involves avoidance) and not writer's block (which implies the absence of ideas). Anfang is the readiness that cannot become motion — the engine running, the car in neutral.

---

**retronostalgia** *(n.)* The longing, in middle age, not for the past itself but for the particular experience of *anticipating* the future that you had when you were young. You do not miss being 22; you miss the feeling that everything was still possible, and the specific flavor that feeling had when you had it.

---

**the accumulation** *(n., uncountable)* The weight of everything you know about a person that you cannot unknow. Begins at zero and increases in one direction only. "After 15 years, the accumulation was substantial." Related to but distinct from love, though love is often one of its contents.

---

**bystander vertigo** *(n.)* The disorientation experienced when watching someone make a significant mistake in real time and being unable or unwilling to intervene. The simultaneous awareness of what is happening and the fact that you are not stopping it. Often accompanied by the fantasy of an alternative timeline in which you did stop it.

---

**the return of self** *(n., the ~)* The specific sensation, after finishing a book or film or any sustained imaginative experience, of re-inhabiting your own perspective — the slight jar of returning from one mind to another, your own. "The end of the film brought the usual return of self, accompanied by the familiar uncertainty about which reality was more real."

---

**palimpsest recognition** *(n.)* The moment, in a familiar place, of suddenly perceiving all its previous versions simultaneously — the room as it was when you first saw it, as it was when something important happened there, as it was last year. The layering of versions in a space, made briefly visible. "Standing in her childhood kitchen, she experienced palimpsest recognition, and for a moment saw all four decades at once."

---

**pre-loss** *(n.)* The anticipatory grief that arises when you are still in possession of something you know you will lose. "He spent his mother's last year in a state of pre-loss, unable to be fully present without the awareness of what was coming."

---

**the obvious question** *(n., the ~)* The question that everyone at a meeting or gathering wants to ask but no one asks, usually because it is too simple or too direct or would reveal that everyone has been operating on an incorrect assumption. "The meeting ran for two hours before someone finally asked the obvious question."

---

**echo error** *(n.)* The experience of having caused harm by repeating back to someone a distorted version of what they told you — the distortion having seemed, at the time, like understanding. "He didn't realize until years later that his consistent reframing of her experiences had constituted a sustained echo error."

---

**threshold nostalgia** *(n.)* The bittersweet feeling, at the beginning of something good, that it is already almost over. "She arrived at the beach house and felt immediately the threshold nostalgia that would accompany the whole week." Not pessimism — something more specific and more tender. The knowledge that the good thing is finite, arriving simultaneously with the good thing.

---

**the solved room** *(n.)* The state of a space after it has finally been organized in a way that works — that feels, for the first time, *right*. Distinct from merely clean or tidy; the solved room has a logic that is now visible. Known to be temporary but experienced as final.

---

**functional honesty** *(n.)* The strange condition of saying a true thing in a tone or context that makes it indistinguishable from a false thing, or that communicates the opposite of what it literally says. "I'm fine" delivered after a long pause; "That's an interesting idea" said at the end of a long meeting. The words are true; the communication is not.

---

**terminal tangent** *(n.)* A digression that becomes so interesting that the original point is never recovered. Not necessarily a problem; the terminal tangent is often the better topic. "Forty minutes later, the original question had been entirely displaced by its terminal tangent, which was, everyone agreed, more interesting."

*Note: several of these already exist in other languages. The definitions above are for English speakers encountering them for the first time, in the hope that naming them makes them available.*
