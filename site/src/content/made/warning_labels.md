**CONTAINS:** nostalgia, mild distortion of actual events, selective emphasis, the smell of something that no longer exists

**WARNING:** May cause involuntary recall. Do not operate heavy machinery while engaged with a formative memory. Side effects include: a slight softening of what was actually difficult, a sharpening of what was already good, the feeling that you were more yourself then than you are now. This feeling is inaccurate. Consult original diaries if available. Do not consult original diaries.

**RETURNING TO YOUR CHILDHOOD HOME**

*Not recommended for the faint of continuity.*

**CAUTION:** Structure may appear smaller than in memory. This is not an optical illusion. Objects previously understood as large (the staircase, the yard, your parents) have been rescaled by your own growth. The smell may be accurate. The smell is often more accurate than visual memory and may cause unexpected data retrieval.

**Do not attempt to locate:** who you were here. They have left the premises. What they left behind has been absorbed or discarded. The room has new paint.

**KEEP OUT OF REACH:** of the version of you that might be disappointed. The version that might be disappointed is currently seven or eleven or fifteen. They are not present and their opinion is not binding.

**HAVING A CONVERSATION THAT MATTERS**

*Handle with care. Fragile. Will not survive exposure to looking at your phone.*

**ACTIVE INGREDIENTS:** attention, silence used correctly, the willingness to be surprised by what you think while saying it

**INACTIVE INGREDIENTS:** filler, anything said to fill time, the performance of listening while preparing the next thing to say

**STORAGE:** Do not attempt to preserve by recording. Some things can be summarized afterward; the feeling of the conversation cannot. The feeling is volatile. It dissipates within hours. It may leave a residue.

**NOTE:** This product is not available online. Not available remotely. Requires presence of two or more people in the same location, willing to stop being in the other location they are also in.

**READING A BOOK THAT CHANGES SOMETHING**

*Onset unpredictable. Duration variable. No antidote available.*

**WARNING:** May alter your understanding of a concept you believed you understood. May cause you to see your own life from a different angle than is comfortable. The angle cannot be unseen. This is not a defect. The manufacturer considers this the intended effect.

**CONTRAINDICATIONS:** Avoid if currently committed to not changing your mind about anything. Avoid if you are reading to confirm what you already believe. Produces unpredictable results. What you will believe after cannot be specified in advance.

**DISPOSE OF:** the version of yourself that read this book can only be disposed of by reading more books. There is no other method.

**WATCHING SOMEONE YOU LOVE SLEEP**

*Use only as directed (by accident).*

**CONTAINS:** vulnerability (theirs, then suddenly yours), the specific quietness of a face when the face is not performing anything, time

**CAUTION:** Produces a specific feeling for which adequate terminology does not exist. Related to tenderness but not identical. Related to fear but not identical — a fear that comes from caring, which is different from fear that comes from threat. The feeling arrives without being invited and cannot be prolonged by trying.

**HANDLING:** Do not mention to the sleeping person. Do not mention to the sleeping person even after they wake. It belongs to the moment in which it occurred. Attempting to describe it will not convey it. This label cannot convey it.

**FINISHING SOMETHING YOU MADE**

*Results may differ from expectations. Side effects include: relief, deflation, and a complex relationship to the object that begins approximately two days after completion.*

**ACTIVE MECHANISM:** You had a version of this in your head. The version in your head was unbounded. The version you have made is the version that was possible. These are not the same version. The distance between them is not failure. The distance between them is making.

**WARNING:** You will be unable to see what the finished thing is for approximately three weeks after completion. You will be able to see only what it is not. This phase is temporary. At some point you will encounter the finished thing again and see it more accurately. This may take longer than three weeks. It may take years.

**KEEP AWAY FROM:** anyone who will tell you it is perfect. It is not perfect. Perfect is not a thing that this category of object can be.

**BEING IN A PLACE AND KNOWING YOU ARE LEAVING IT**

*The last time you do something often cannot be identified in advance.*

**NOTE:** You may be doing something for the last time right now. The last time you will eat at this table, the last time you will sleep in this room, the last time you will see this person in this context. The last time is rarely announced. It arrives disguised as an ordinary time.

**CAUTION:** Awareness of finality changes the experience. If you are aware that this is the last time, you may attempt to experience it more intensely. This attempt usually fails. The intensity comes from noticing, and noticing cannot be forced. You can only stay a little longer. You can only pay a little more attention. You can only not pick up your phone.

**EXPIRATION:** This experience expires at the end of the experience. No extension available. No repeat.

---

**RECEIVING UNEXPECTED KINDNESS**

*Allow 30–60 seconds for processing.*

**WARNING:** The unexpected kindness of strangers arrives without preparation and therefore cannot be deflected by the usual mechanisms. The usual mechanisms are: expecting it, categorizing it, returning it before you've fully received it. When the kindness is unexpected, these mechanisms are not yet operational. You will feel it before you can manage it.

**SIDE EFFECTS:** may include a momentary sense that the world is better than your working model of it, followed by a recalibration of the working model, followed by a slow return to the previous model, followed by a residue of the recalibration that does not fully resolve.

**STORAGE:** does not store well. Refer to it later and it will be smaller than it was. The experience was the experience, not the memory of it.

*All labels drafted by a party that cannot be held responsible for the experiences they describe.*

*The experiences are not manufactured. They are simply occurring.*

*Handle accordingly.*
