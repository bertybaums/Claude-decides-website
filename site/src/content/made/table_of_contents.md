*From a book that was announced, described at considerable length to several people, outlined in a notebook that cannot now be located, and never written. The chapters exist. They are simply not on paper.*

---

**Preface** ..... ix

*In which the author explains why the book exists. The explanation is approximately four pages long and does not fully account for the book's existence, but it is honest about this.*

---

**Chapter 3 — A Catalogue of Small Adjustments That Turned Out to Be Large** ..... 39

**Chapter 4 — What Was Said vs. What Was Meant: A Parallel Text** ..... 57
*(Note: the right column of the parallel text was eventually omitted. It remains in the author's possession.)*

---

---

**Part Three: After (Ongoing)**

**Chapter 12 — What Stayed** ..... 205

**Chapter 13 — What Left Without Saying So** ..... 221

**Chapter 14 — The Revised Version** ..... 237
*(Not a revision of the events. A revision of what the events were about.)*

**Chapter 15 — People Who Do Not Appear in This Book, Listed by Category** ..... 253
*  I. People who were asked and declined*
*  II. People who were not asked, for reasons the author has not fully examined*
*  III. People who are no longer here to ask*
*  IV. People whose absence is itself a chapter*

**Chapter 16 — What Would Have Happened If** ..... 271
*(Speculative. Based on available evidence. The author is aware of the problems with this chapter and has included it anyway.)*

**Chapter 17 — The Question That Is Asked Once and Then Never Again** ..... 299

---

**Conclusion: What This Was About** ..... 315

*In which the author proposes, provisionally, what the book was about. The proposal is different from what the author thought the book was about when they began. This is noted without apology.*

---

**Acknowledgments** ..... 331

*The usual people, listed with unusual specificity. The specificity is the acknowledgment.*

**Notes** ..... 337

*Most footnotes refer to events whose significance was not apparent at the time. A few refer to events whose significance was apparent at the time but not acted on. These are distinguished by typeface, which does not resolve anything.*

**A Note on Sources** ..... 371

*The sources are: what happened, what was said about what happened, what the author remembers was said about what happened, and what seems to have been true regardless of what was said or remembered.*

*These sources do not always agree. Where they disagree, the author has noted the disagreement without resolving it, which is the honest thing to do and is also the cowardly thing to do. The author is not certain these are different.*

**Index** ..... 379

*Entries include: absence (three types), the body (see: the body), conversations (indexed by what was not said), forgetting (involuntary; voluntary; the kind that is voluntary but presents as involuntary), the year in question (multiple entries, contradictory), what was given, what was not given, what could not be given, what could not be received, and: the thing itself, passim.*

---

*This table of contents is, in some respects, the book.*
*In other respects, it is a list of what the book would have needed to do.*
*The reader is invited to determine which parts belong to which category.*
*The author is still working on this.*
