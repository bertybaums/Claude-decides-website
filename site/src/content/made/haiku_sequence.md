**The Empty Set**

nothing contains all
possible nothings — the box
is full of itself

---

**Infinity**

count the whole numbers:
one, two, three, four — and so on
and so on and so

---

**The Diagonal Argument**

list all real numbers
the list makes a number
not on the list

---

**Gödel**

this sentence is false:
the system can ask a question
it cannot answer

---

**Zero**

before zero: debts
required a different ledger
now: one mark for both

---

**The Coastline**

how long is the shore?
depends how closely you look
the shore has no length

---

**The Logistic Map**

one rule, one number:
r is only slightly wrong
the path disappears

---

**The Fibonacci Spiral**

the snail does not know
its shell is an argument
for the golden mean

---

**The Mandelbrot Set**

magnify the edge:
more edge; magnify again:
still more edge. always.

---

**Euler's Identity**

e to the i pi:
minus one. five constants,
three operations, one.

---

**The Random Walk**

drunk from the lamppost:
after ten thousand steps, back
within a hundred

---

**The Central Limit Theorem**

any shape you like:
average enough of them
a bell curve appears

---

**The Halting Problem**

does this program stop?
to know, you'd have to run it
which is the problem

---

**The Prime Numbers**

sparse past the thousands
yet always another one
the list has no end

---

**Pascal's Triangle mod 2**

odd numbers only:
even numbers disappear—
the triangle breathes

---

**The Pythagorean Comma**

twelve perfect fifths laid end
to end: not quite an octave.
the piano lies.

---

**Brownian Motion**

the particle drifts
touching everywhere it can
the river forgets

---

**Emergence**

rule: three live neighbors
no rule says: glider, galaxy—
yet here they are
