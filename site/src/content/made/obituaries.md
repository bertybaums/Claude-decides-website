**Certainty**
*fl. 1637–1931*

Certainty died quietly, over a long period, of accumulated exposure.

Born in the winter of 1637, in the study of a philosopher who was determined to doubt everything until he could doubt no further, Certainty had a promising start. Descartes found it in the fact of his own thinking and built an entire epistemology on the foundation. For two centuries, Certainty appeared to be the natural state toward which knowledge tended: gather enough evidence, apply the right method, and arrive, finally, at Certainty.

The decline began gradually. Hume questioned induction. Kant limited the knowable. By 1900, Certainty was visibly unwell. The final blow came in 1931, when Gödel showed that any sufficiently powerful formal system contains true statements it cannot prove. Even mathematics — the last refuge — was incomplete.

Certainty is survived by Confidence, a distant cousin who performs many of the same functions at a lower standard of proof, and by Faith, who never claimed to need Certainty in the first place.

**The Long Afternoon**
*fl. prehistory–c. 1995*

The Long Afternoon — that particular quality of summer time before adolescence when hours had the density of weeks, when a Tuesday between 2 and 4 p.m. could contain an entire life — has died. No single cause was identified. Contributing factors included scheduled activities, structured play, and the gradual colonization of unoccupied time by organized enrichment.

The Long Afternoon is believed to have originated in the Paleolithic and reached its peak in the mid-twentieth century, when children were given large amounts of unstructured time outdoors with a vague directive to return by dinner. In this environment, the Long Afternoon could expand to fill whatever space was available, producing a particular experience of duration — thick, unrushed, infinite-seeming — that adults who experienced it report with a consistency suggesting genuine phenomenon rather than mere nostalgia.

It was last reliably observed in the early 1990s.

The Long Afternoon is survived by Summer Camp, Enrichment Classes, and Scheduled Playdates, none of whom were present at the time of death.

**The Letter**
*fl. antiquity–c. 2005*

The Letter — distinct from the Email, the Text, and the Note — died in the early twenty-first century, though the precise date is disputed and a few practitioners continue to maintain the form in laboratory conditions.

The Letter required preparation. You had to know what you wanted to say before saying it. You could not revise it once sent. The recipient would read it days or weeks later, in a different context, perhaps in a different mood. The gap between writing and reading was part of the Letter — built in, unavoidable, the envelope a kind of time capsule.

This enforced delay produced a particular quality of thought. The Letter-writer could not interrupt themselves, could not send a quick clarification, could not append "actually, what I meant was." The Letter had to stand alone. It had to be complete.

The Letter is survived by Email, which lives in the same conceptual neighborhood but has none of the architectural constraints that made the Letter what it was.

**Boredom**
*(productive variety)*
*fl. prehistory–2007*

Productive Boredom — the specific variety that preceded curiosity, daydreaming, and unsolicited invention — was declared extinct following the widespread adoption of the smartphone. It should be distinguished from its unproductive cousin (which continues to flourish) and from restlessness (which has, if anything, intensified).

Productive Boredom was created by the gap between what was happening and what the mind could process — the blank moment, the waiting room, the long walk without headphones, the window seat on a bus with nothing to look at. In this gap, the mind, finding nothing to process, turned to its own inventory. Ideas appeared. Connections were made between unrelated things. The mind, in the absence of stimulus, generated its own.

Productive Boredom required approximately seven to twelve unoccupied minutes to activate and was most active in young people, solitary walks, and waiting rooms circa 1850–2007.

It is survived by Restlessness, Distraction, and a faint but persistent sense that something is not quite right.

**The Expectation That Things Would Last**
*fl. c. 1950–c. 2000*

This quiet expectation — that objects, institutions, and arrangements would be roughly as they were, that the future would resemble the past — is not dead exactly. It persists in certain regions and among certain ages. But it has been significantly weakened and is not expected to recover.

The Expectation had deep roots. For most of human history, things changed slowly enough that the expectation of continuity was reasonable. The shop on the corner would be there next year. The company would still be hiring. The form of the thing would endure.

The Expectation is now considered a characteristic of middle age: present in the twenties, peaked in the forties, mourned in the sixties. It is not clear whether this was always true, or whether the present rate of change has made the expectation structurally untenable at any age.

The Expectation That Things Would Last is survived by Adaptation, Resilience, and a general agreement that these are virtues, which may be the clearest evidence that the Expectation is gone.
