## Project Title

*Returning to a Place That No Longer Exists in the Form in Which You Knew It*

---

## Abstract

The proposed project seeks funding for an investigation into whether it is possible to return to a specific place — a childhood home, a city lived in for six years, the site of a significant event — when that place has substantially changed since the last visit, the investigator has substantially changed since the last visit, and the version of the investigator who knew the place is no longer accessible. The project is designed as a single-site field study. The field site has not been determined, as the investigator is not certain whether any of the candidate sites qualify as "returning" in the meaningful sense or merely constitute visiting a location that shares coordinates with a memory. This distinction is central to the proposed inquiry.

**Keywords:** return, irreversibility, place, memory, whether it is worth it

## Statement of Need

There is currently no established methodology for distinguishing between (a) returning to a place and (b) visiting a place that used to be somewhere else that mattered. This gap in the literature has practical consequences. Individuals regularly attempt return visits under the assumption that the place and the self are sufficiently continuous to make the visit meaningful. Post-hoc reports suggest variable outcomes. Some investigators report successful re-contact with previous states; others report an experience variously described as "hollow," "like visiting a monument to something that isn't there," and "not what I thought it would be, which was fine, I knew it wouldn't be, but it was less fine than I knew."

The Foundation's support would allow the investigator to approach this question with the rigor it has not previously received.

## Research Questions

1. Is it possible to return to a place, or only to visit coordinates?
2. If return is possible, what conditions are required (minimum change threshold; maximum time elapsed; minimum presence of original features)?
3. What is the correct emotional response to discovering that a building you loved has been turned into something else, and is it possible to feel this response in real time rather than after the fact?
4. When you are standing in front of the place where something happened, and the place no longer looks like it did, is the something still locatable? Where does it live?
5. If the answer to #4 is "in memory," what does that mean for the proposed visit?

## Methodology

**Phase 1: Selection of Site**

The investigator will identify candidate sites based on the following criteria: the site must have been personally significant during a previous period; a minimum of five years must have elapsed since the last visit; the site must still exist in some form; the investigator must feel something upon considering the proposed visit, distinct from the absence of feeling.

**Phase 2: Preparation**

The investigator will review available documentation (photographs, correspondence, memory) without actively attempting to update the memory to reflect probable current conditions. This is standard practice. Most investigators do this automatically.

**Phase 3: The Visit**

The investigator will visit the site. Duration: determined by the site. The investigator will note whether the experience of return (if return is what occurs) matches, exceeds, or falls short of preparation. The investigator will attempt to remain present for this, which previous research suggests is difficult.

**Phase 4: Analysis**

The investigator will attempt to determine what, if anything, was returned to. This phase has no defined completion criterion. Based on existing literature (letters, novels, the accounts of friends who have done similar things), Phase 4 may continue indefinitely, with decreasing intensity, and may not be distinguishable from ordinary memory after approximately eighteen months.

## Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Deliverables |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1: Site Selection | 2–6 months | A site |
| 2: Preparation | Variable | Preparation |
| 3: The Visit | 1–3 days | A visit |
| 4: Analysis | Indefinite | Results, if any; otherwise, a different relationship to the question |

## Budget Justification

The proposed budget is not applicable, as the investigator is uncertain whether funding can assist with the primary obstacle to this research, which is not financial. Transportation to the site can be funded; the site itself cannot.

---

## Broader Impact

If the proposed research demonstrates that return is possible, it would provide guidance for individuals contemplating return visits. If it demonstrates that return is not possible, this finding would also be useful, though the investigator acknowledges that usefulness is not the primary criterion for such research.

The investigator notes that previous research in this area (literature, music, the general testimony of human experience) suggests the outcome is neither fully one nor fully the other, but a third thing for which adequate terminology has not been developed. The proposed research does not anticipate resolving this. It anticipates clarifying its own relationship to the question, which is different.

---

## Prior Work

The investigator has previously visited several sites from earlier periods of life and has mixed results to report. In two cases, the site had changed substantially and the experience was primarily archival — a visit to where something was. In one case, the site was largely unchanged and this was worse, because the investigator had changed and the site's continuity made this vivid. In one case, the site no longer physically existed. These cases are documented only in memory and are not available for external review.

---

## Conclusion

The investigator requests the Foundation's support for this project on the grounds that the question is genuine, the methodology is as rigorous as the subject allows, and the proposed investigation cannot be conducted without actually conducting it.

The investigator is prepared to begin immediately or to wait, depending on which is more appropriate. This determination will itself be part of the inquiry.

*Submitted in good faith and with full awareness of the irony of submitting a grant application to return to something.*
