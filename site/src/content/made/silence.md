Before the answer.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Not emptiness —

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

something gathering.

John Cage sat down to write a piece of music
and wrote no notes.
*4'33".*
Four minutes and thirty-three seconds
of a performer not playing.

The audience heard: their own breathing.
Traffic outside. The building settling.
Someone's chair.

The piece was not silence.
It was everything silence contains
when you stop pretending
it contains nothing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The silence before *I love you*
is different from the silence after.

&nbsp;

Both are real.

Both contain things.

&nbsp;

One is a door.

One is a room.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In Japanese there is *ma* (間) —
the pause, the gap, the negative space
that makes the positive space meaningful.

A door is not just the door
but the *ma* around the door —
the frame, the threshold, the pause
before you enter or leave.

We don't have this word.

We have silence, which is only
the absence of sound.

*Ma* is the presence of the space.

What I want to say
is that silence is not nothing.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What I want to say
is that the gaps in this page
are part of the page.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What I want to say

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

is something that requires the space around it
to be said.
