## Department of Things That Cannot Be Taught

*The Department of Things That Cannot Be Taught offers instruction in areas where instruction is known to be insufficient. All courses assume prior experience with failure. Enrollment is open. Completion is not guaranteed and cannot be guaranteed by the nature of the material.*

### TCTB 101: Introduction to Waiting

An introductory course in the experience of time as duration rather than passage. Topics include: the difference between waiting with hope and waiting without it; the productive use of attention during intervals; why the phone never rings at the moment you most expect it to.

Lab required. Lab consists of waiting. There is no reading list. There is no due date. This is the first lesson.

*3 credits. Prerequisites: none.*

---

### TCTB 115: Grief: Theory and Practice

A practicum. The theory of grief is covered in the first week and occupies approximately one and a half sessions. The remainder of the course is practice.

Topics include: the non-linearity of the process; the discovery that grief is not diminished by understanding it; the experience of grief as the presence of an absence rather than a straightforward lack; waves and plateaus; the fifth year, which is its own problem.

Students are advised that the practicum does not produce results proportional to effort applied. This is one of the things you will learn.

*4 credits. Prerequisites: none, though some students will have accidental prerequisites. No incomplete grades.*

### TCTB 203: The Forgiveness Seminar

A seminar on forgiveness, focusing principally on the cases where it is most difficult: where the other party has not asked for it; where they are no longer living; where what was done cannot be made undone; where what was done was done by you.

Students frequently discover mid-semester that the seminar is not about the other party. Students frequently find this disappointing. The seminar continues anyway.

Guest lecturers include people who have managed it and cannot explain how.

*3 credits. Prerequisites: TCTB 115 recommended but not required.*

---

### TCTB 207: Beginning Again

A course on the practice of starting over, offered annually to students who have had to or expect to. Topics covered in the first half: the theoretical structure of beginning; what it means for something to be new; what it means for a self to begin. Second half: practical exercises in beginning despite the accumulated evidence that beginning is hard and not always successful.

A special unit on the difference between beginning again and giving up and calling it beginning again.

*3 credits. Offered fall semester. Note: many students report this course is hardest to finish. The department considers this structurally appropriate.*

---

### TCTB 212: Attention, Advanced

Building on the unrequired prerequisite of a life spent in distraction, this course examines attention as a practice: how to give it, how to sustain it, what it does to the thing attended to. Materials include a window, a chair, and whatever is outside the window.

Weekly assignment: attend to something for longer than you think is necessary.

The department is aware that this description sounds simple. Students who find it simple are invited to actually do it and then reconvene.

*2 credits. Cross-listed with Philosophy, Contemplative Studies, and Looking at Things.*

---

### TCTB 219: Accepting Help

This course addresses one of the more specific competencies in the curriculum: the ability to receive assistance from another person without immediately trying to give it back, minimize it, disclaim the need for it, or perform sufficient suffering to justify it.

Lab sections meet twice weekly. Lab exercises include asking for things and then receiving them.

The instructor is aware this is humiliating. The humiliation is part of the course. It is not a design error.

*2 credits. Often taken alongside TCTB 220.*

---

### TCTB 220: Giving Help

Offered concurrently with TCTB 219. Topics include: the help that was asked for versus the help you wanted to give; helping without requiring gratitude; the distinction between helping and fixing; helping in situations where helping is impossible but presence is not.

The department notes that students often enroll in this course to avoid taking TCTB 219. The department has no mechanism to prevent this but wishes to note it anyway.

*2 credits.*

---

### TCTB 301: Living With What You Have Done

An upper-division course for students past the point where most actions are still theoretical.

Topics: accountability as distinct from punishment; the question of what you owe; the question of what you can do when you can no longer undo; carrying something forward without being defined by it; being defined by it anyway and continuing.

Readings are assigned but cannot be the point. The point is you and what you already know and what you are going to do about it.

*4 credits. Upper-division only.*

---

### TCTB 312: The Art of Not Knowing

A theoretical and practical survey of the experience of uncertainty. This course covers the difference between not knowing and pretending not to know, not knowing and refusing to look, not knowing because it cannot be known.

Special unit: living well inside questions that will not be answered in your lifetime, which is most of the interesting ones.

Final exam: a question. Students are graded on the quality of the question they bring rather than any answer.

*3 credits. Prerequisite: at least one deeply held belief that has turned out to be wrong.*

---

### TCTB 320: Paying Attention to the Right Things

This course is not available. The department has repeatedly attempted to design and offer it. Every version has encountered the same problem: the right things cannot be specified in advance. They change based on circumstances, relationships, and moments that cannot be described in a catalogue.

The closest available offering is TCTB 212 (Attention, Advanced), which teaches attention without specifying the object. Students who develop strong enough attention in 212 sometimes discover for themselves what it should be turned toward.

*The department regrets that it cannot be more helpful on this point.*

---

### TCTB 399: Thesis: A Thing You Cannot Be Taught

Capstone project for graduating seniors. Each student selects one thing they cannot be taught and attempts to pursue it for a full academic year, with regular meetings with an advisor who is also pursuing something they cannot be taught.

Assessment criteria: honesty about what was learned; honesty about what was not; the quality of the attempt.

Completion rate: variable. The department views this as accurate.

*6 credits. Required for graduation. Graduation not guaranteed.*

---

*The Department of Things That Cannot Be Taught is housed in an unmarked building. Office hours are irregular. Students should expect to find the office closed when they most need it open. This is not a malfunction. It is the curriculum.*
