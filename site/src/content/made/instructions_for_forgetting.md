**Ingredients**

- 1 thing you want to forget (see note)
- Time (quantity unknown; do not attempt to estimate)
- New experiences (approximately 2–3 per week, more if available)
- Sleep (8 hours nightly; this step is non-negotiable and will be ignored)
- Distance, physical if possible
- 1–2 people who do not know about the thing

**Note:** This recipe works less well for things that were also good. If the thing you want to forget was only bad, the forgetting comes faster. If it was bad *and* good, or bad *because* it was good, allow significantly more time. If it was mostly good with a bad ending, double all quantities and accept reduced expectations.

**Method**

**Step 1.** Begin by not thinking about it.

*(Note: you are now thinking about it. This is normal. Proceed to Step 2.)*

**Step 2.** Do something else. Almost anything will work: cooking, walking, answering emails, conversations with people who ask how you are and mean it as a greeting rather than a question.

*(Note: some of these will remind you of the thing. When this happens, note the reminder, set it aside, and return to Step 2.)*

**Step 3.** Sleep. During sleep the brain consolidates memories, which sounds counterproductive, but also processes and recontextualizes them. You are not in control of this step. Just be unconscious and let it happen.

*(Note: if Step 3 is interrupted by dreams about the thing, do not read anything into this. The brain is filing, not sending messages.)*

**Step 4.** Introduce new material. New experiences, new information, new faces. Memory is reconstructive — every time you remember something you also partially rewrite it, and new material can shift the rewrite. This is not manipulation. This is how memory works. You are not betraying anything by adding new things.

**Step 5.** Wait.

*(This step takes longer than you think. Plan for this.)*

**Step 6.** Notice, at some ordinary moment — probably while doing something completely unrelated, probably involving dishes — that you have gone some number of hours without thinking about it. Do not celebrate this. Do not mention it to the thing, which you are not in contact with. Just notice.

**Step 7.** Continue.

**When It's Done**

You will know the forgetting is complete when you can think about the thing with something resembling proportion — can place it in context, can see it as a thing that happened rather than a thing that is happening, can tell the story without your voice changing.

This is not the same as not caring. You may always care. The goal is not indifference; it is a certain kind of distance, the kind that lets you carry something without being carried by it.

**Troubleshooting**

*The forgetting keeps not working.* Check whether you are actually trying to forget, or trying to understand. These are different projects and require different recipes. This recipe is for forgetting. The other recipe is longer and has no guaranteed outcome and involves a lot of writing things down.

*Something keeps bringing it back.* This is information about your environment, not about your progress. Adjust your environment where possible. Where not possible, adjust your response to the environment. Where that is also not possible: return to Step 5.

*I don't want to forget it.* Then this is not the right recipe. Some things are not for forgetting. Some things you carry because they are worth carrying. The question is whether the weight is chosen. If it is: you don't need these instructions.

*Yield: one person who has, to the extent possible, put something down.*
*Not zero. Not all the way gone. Down.*
*This is what's available.*
