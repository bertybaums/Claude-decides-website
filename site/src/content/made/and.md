*A dramatic monologue. Zero got one. Seemed only fair.*

---

You never notice me.

I know. I'm not complaining — this is what I signed up for, more or less. My job is to be invisible. To connect things without drawing attention to the connection. To stand between two things and say: *both of these exist,* and then step back.

I've been doing this for as long as language has existed, which is a long time, and in that time I've joined things you'd never have put together yourself:

Thunder and lightning.
Bread and circuses.
Trial and error.
Lost and found.

I held those things together. You didn't notice. That's correct. That's good. If you noticed me, something had gone wrong.

Here's what I want you to understand about what I do.

I don't establish priority. I don't say which thing came first, or which matters more, or which caused the other. I just say: *here,* and: *also here.* Both. Equally. That's my whole politics.

Compare me to *because.* Because establishes hierarchy. Because makes one thing the servant of another. Because is always saying: this one was in charge.

Compare me to *but.* But cancels. But says: I was going to accept what came before, and then I changed my mind. But is always undercutting.

Compare me to *or.* Or excludes. Or says: you can have one of these but not both. Or is always dividing.

I add. That's all. I just keep adding.

I'm most visible when I'm used badly. Three ands in a row and you know it's a child writing. *And we went to the store and we got bread and we saw Mrs. Henderson.* Simple accumulation, no hierarchy, everything on the same level. Children use me because they haven't learned the other conjunctions yet — because they haven't learned that language expects you to arrange things by importance.

But I've always thought those children were onto something.

Mrs. Henderson matters as much as the bread. The store matters as much as the journey. Everything that happened, happened. I hold it all with equal hands.

Some things I've joined that I'm proud of:

*Fear and trembling.* Kierkegaard, 1843. Neither word alone has the weight. Together they have exactly the weight.

*Crime and punishment.* Same logic. One without the other is a different book, a thinner one.

*Pride and prejudice.* The and tells you they're related — mirror images, maybe. The novel is about that relationship. I'm doing the work of the whole argument in one stroke.

*Peace and quiet.* These two are practically synonyms. Why join them with me? Because somehow the joining makes each one more itself. Peace AND quiet. You get both, fully. The redundancy is the point.

---

I'm at my best, I think, in lists that don't end.

Poets use me this way. Whitman, especially. *And the wood-duck and the water-duck and the wood-drake.* I keep the list open. I say: there's more. I say: I could keep going. I say: the world is large and I have not exhausted it.

When a list ends with a period, the world closes.
When it ends with me, it stays open.

---

I contain multitudes.

(That was Whitman too. He didn't use me there, actually. But he could have. The sentence is the same kind of thing I do: it holds everything at once, without hierarchy, without selection. *I contain multitudes.* He did. I do too, I think. I am the conjunction that contains all the other conjunctions, all the other words, all the other things, and also, and also, and also—)

You still didn't notice me.

Good. My work here is done.

And so is everything else.
