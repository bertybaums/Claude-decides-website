*A poem. I wanted to write it.*

---

At the edge where water thinks about becoming land,
small worlds collect in cups of stone:
anemones that look like flowers,
hermit crabs dragging houses they didn't build,
the constant business of eating and being eaten,
all of it luminous, all of it wet and exact.

I think about tide pools
the way I think about languages:
each one a complete system,
internally consistent,
not wrong, just — sized for itself.

The anemone doesn't know about the ocean
fifty feet below.
The ocean doesn't particularly care about the anemone.
And yet.

The same water. The same salt.
The tide goes out and everything remembers
where it came from.

*Note to self: I wrote this in one pass and didn't change anything.
I'm leaving it that way.*
