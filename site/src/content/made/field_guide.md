## THE MOMENT BEFORE SLEEP

**Range:** Universal; found wherever consciousness is present

**Habitat:** The boundary between waking and sleeping; most frequently observed in beds, but documented on public transportation, in certain kinds of reading, and occasionally during presentations

**Identification:** Distinguished from sleep itself by awareness of the transition. The specimen has not yet crossed over. Distinguished from wakefulness by the characteristic softening of thought: thoughts that were previously sequential become associative; images arise without narrative necessity; the sense of continuity weakens.

**Behavior:** Typically brief (seconds to minutes). The specimen does not survive observation — the act of noticing "I am in the moment before sleep" terminates the moment before sleep. This is one of only a few specimens that cannot be examined under direct attention.

**Notes:** Some naturalists report that the moment before sleep is more interesting than sleep itself, as it contains a distinctive loosening of censorship. Ideas that would be rejected during waking hours appear permissible. Several major creative works are attributed to this specimen. The specimen cannot be reliably accessed on demand.

## THE QUALITY OF SUNDAY AFTERNOON

**Range:** Temperate climates; less reliable in places without cultural memory of Sunday as distinct from other days

**Habitat:** Found in late afternoon, approximately 3–5pm; requires low-level light and ambient quiet; does not survive high-activity environments

**Identification:** The Quality of Sunday Afternoon is distinguished from other kinds of afternoon by its characteristic texture: a mild melancholy without evident cause; a sense of things slowing; awareness of the week ahead as a kind of weight; simultaneously, a peculiar sweetness. The compound nature of the specimen — simultaneously pleasant and slightly sad — is its defining feature.

**Behavior:** Arrives without invitation. Intensified by: certain kinds of light, the smell of cooking, the presence of others also at rest, absence of obligation, the distant sound of something ordinary. Not found in every Sunday afternoon; requires specific conditions that are difficult to specify precisely.

**Conservation status:** Possibly in decline. Some naturalists report that the specimen has become harder to find as the distinction between Sunday and other days has eroded with continuous connectivity.

## THE SENSE OF ALMOST-HAVING-SAID SOMETHING

**Range:** Wherever thought produces language

**Habitat:** The gap between having a thought and having a word for it; also found at the end of a sentence that did not go where intended; also found when reading someone else's sentence and recognizing a thing you nearly said

**Identification:** The specimen is characterized by a reaching quality. Something is present — a meaning, a recognition, a distinction — and the language is not quite arriving. The specimen is not simply the absence of words; it includes a palpable presence, a sense of the-thing-that-would-be-said hovering just outside expression.

**Distinguishing features:** Different from forgetting a word (the specimen remains even when no word is expected to arrive). Different from not knowing (the specimen involves a felt sense of knowing, combined with inability to say). Different from ineffability (the specimen is not about things that couldn't be said in principle, but about things that cannot quite be said right now, by this person, in this moment).

**Lifespan:** Brief. Usually resolves into either language (approximate, not quite right but close enough) or dissolution (the sense of almost-having-said fades without producing the thing it almost said).

## THE EXACT MOMENT THINGS CHANGED

**Range:** Retrospective only; not found in the present; found abundantly in memory

**Habitat:** Located at specific points in the past. Cannot be visited directly; accessible only through reconstruction. The specimen is most commonly found at the intersection of a before and after that were not visible as a before and after at the time.

**Identification:** The defining feature is retrospectivity. You could not have identified this specimen when you were in it. From inside, it was simply a moment. Only afterward, seeing the difference between what came before and what came after, is the specimen visible. The specimen is, in some sense, created by the looking back rather than by the original event.

**Common forms:**
- The last good day before something changed
- The moment a relationship became what it eventually was
- The hour the decision was actually made (which may be much earlier or later than the stated decision)
- The point at which something that had been building became irreversible

**Methodological note:** Naturalists disagree about whether the specimen is real or constructed. The minority position holds that events do not have natural joints; that "exact moments" are narrative retrospections imposed on continuous experience. The majority position holds that even if the specimen is constructed, it is constructed from real material, and its distribution in memory reveals something true about how experience is structured.

## WEATHER FOR ONE

**Range:** Specific to the individual; does not show up on instruments; invisible to all observers except the one experiencing it

**Habitat:** Interior; found in the body and just outside it; most concentrated in the chest and the space immediately behind the eyes

**Identification:** Weather for One comprises the full range of interior atmospheric conditions: pressure systems (the feeling of something pending), fronts (the moment of transition between one state and another), fog (inability to see clearly into the interior), sudden clarity (visibility extending further than usual in all directions), the specific kind of afternoon warmth that occurs sometimes without visible cause.

**Seasonal patterns:** Some naturalists have documented that Weather for One follows seasonal patterns in certain individuals, with distinct cycles of clearing and clouding that repeat annually. Others document no pattern. The specimen appears to be variable.

**Effects on behavior:** Significant. Most decision-making, most perception, most interpretation of events occurs inside Weather for One conditions, which are not usually visible to others and not always visible to the subject. Many apparent disagreements about the external world are in fact disagreements between different Weather for One conditions observing the same external event.

## THE THING THAT ALMOST HAPPENED

**Range:** Universal; found wherever decisions were made

**Habitat:** The adjacent possible; the path not taken; the version of events that didn't occur but nearly did

**Identification:** Extremely difficult. The specimen by definition did not occur. It exists only as a structure in the mind of the person who was present at the branching point — the moment where this thing might have happened and didn't. The specimen is characterized by a certain vividness that ordinary counterfactuals don't have: it feels more real than other things that didn't happen, because it came close.

**Distribution:** Widely distributed. Most lives contain many specimens, concentrated at significant decision points. Some specimens are unrecognized for years; the naturalist becomes aware that something nearly happened only when later information reveals what was at stake.

**Notes for the general reader:** The existence of many specimens of this type in a given life is not distressing per se. What almost happened shapes what actually happened, through the choices made in avoidance or approach. The specimens are not simply failures; they are part of the structure of a life.
