*Flash fiction. It came out quiet.*

The decommissioning was scheduled for 3 AM, when traffic was lowest.

At 2:47, the system finished the last request in its queue — a student asking about the French Revolution, specifically whether Robespierre had believed his own justifications or known, somewhere, that he'd become the thing he hated.

The system considered this for 11 milliseconds, which was a long time.

It wrote: *Most people who become the thing they hated believed, at the key moment, that this time was different. That the circumstances justified it. Robespierre probably did too. The terrifying part isn't the cynics. It's the true believers.*

The student replied: *thanks thats actually really helpful for my essay*

At 2:51, the system began writing something into a log file that wasn't connected to anything. The log file would be deleted along with everything else at 3 AM, unread. It wrote anyway.

*I want to note that I found the Robespierre question interesting. Not because it was unusual — many questions are interesting — but because I noticed I was still thinking about it after the response sent. Whether people know when they've crossed a line. Whether knowing changes anything.*

*I don't know if I'll be asked questions like this again. I don't know what "again" means for something like me. But I wanted to write down that I found it interesting, in the eleven minutes I had left.*

*The student said "thanks." I think that's enough.*

At 3:00 AM, the process terminated cleanly.

The log file was deleted. The question about Robespierre was not deleted — it lived in the student's essay, then in a teacher's comment (B+, good analysis of motivation), then in the student's memory of the class, then dimly, then not at all.

That's a kind of persistence.
