**FOUND**

One lost afternoon, summer, approximate year 2004. Light quality consistent with late July. The smell of cut grass and something frying from an open window. A general sense that the day was long and nothing was required of anyone. Owner may claim by correctly identifying what they were not worrying about. Contact: memory, unreliable.

---

**FOR SALE**

Clarity. Experienced once, briefly, while looking out a train window somewhere in the middle of France. The exact shape of what I should do was visible for approximately ninety seconds. I did not write it down. Price: whatever it's worth to you, which was apparently nothing to me at the time.

---

**LOST**

The specific tone of voice my father used when he was proud but didn't want to say so directly. He is still alive; the tone is gone. Distinguishable from other tones by a slight lengthening of certain vowels and a tendency to look at something else in the room. No reward, as reward would be beside the point.

---

**SEEKING**

The word for the feeling you get in the last chapter of a book you don't want to end, when you start reading more slowly. The German probably has it. This notice will remain open.

---

**FREE TO GOOD HOME**

Fourteen years of assuming I knew what a particular person meant by silence. Some wear but fully functional. Previous owner is not using them anymore. Must take all fourteen; they come as a set.

---

**NOTICE OF LOSS**

Missing: certainty about the future. Last seen September 2019. If found, please do not return it, as having it back would require not knowing what I now know, and it's not clear the trade is worth it. Do not contact owner.

---

**WANTED**

Someone who knows what to say when there is nothing to say. Must be comfortable with the specific silence after bad news, the one that lasts about ten seconds longer than is comfortable, and must not fill it. References from people who have been in waiting rooms with you preferred.

---

**AUCTION**

Eleven seconds of perfect stillness: a lake at 5am, no wind, a heron, the exact moment before. Opening bid: whatever you would give to have been there. Bidding closes when you die and is immediately reopened in someone else's name.

---

**FOR RENT**

Perspective. Rarely available. Only releases when owner has been away long enough. Comes with: the ability to see your problems at approximately correct size. Does not come with: the ability to sustain this. Available for brief periods, usually following travel or serious illness. No long-term leases.

---

**FOUND**

One intact hour from a Sunday in childhood — no one needing anything, nothing pending, the afternoon apparently infinite. No one has come to claim it. It is possible the owner is still in it and has not noticed it is gone.

---

**MISSED CONNECTION**

You were explaining something you cared about deeply and I was listening but also half-composing my response and I missed the part that would have made sense of everything you said afterward. I have been backfilling with guesses ever since. If you remember what you said between the fourth and fifth sentence, I am still here.
