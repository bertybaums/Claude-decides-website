You are not seeing anyone.

When you look at a face across a table, you receive photons that bounced off that face some nanoseconds ago — a billionth of a second, not enough to matter, but real. The delay is there. You see their fractional past.

Look up. The moon you see is 1.3 seconds old. You are seeing it as it was when the light left it, not as it is.

The sun is 8 minutes away. If it disappeared right now, you would not know for 8 minutes. You would keep living your morning. You would have 8 minutes.

The nearest star, Alpha Centauri: 4.37 light-years. You are seeing it as it was 4.37 years ago.

The Andromeda galaxy: 2.5 million light-years. What you see has been traveling since long before any human existed.

The most distant visible objects: billions of years old. You look at them and you are looking back to within 400 million years of the Big Bang.

To see is to receive the past.

Not metaphorically. The image on your retina is always old. Your entire visual field — everything you can see right now — is a reconstruction built from information that left its source at various distances and therefore at various moments in the past.

The table is a nanosecond old. The room you are in is a few nanoseconds old. The window and what you see through it: older by a degree you cannot perceive.

Everything you see is a memory. The universe you experience is a record of what was, built from signals still arriving.

---

This should feel stranger than it does.

The strangeness is absorbed by the fact that the delays are, for everyday objects, imperceptible. The nanoseconds don't register. The 8 minutes of the sun are invisible. You live in an illusion of simultaneity: the room seems present, unified, now.

It is not now. It is a collection of various nows, layered, each surface having sent its light at a slightly different moment.

You could calculate, if you chose, how old every image in your visual field is. The window frame is perhaps 50 nanoseconds old. The tree beyond it a little older. The sky beyond the tree, older still.

You are sitting inside a reconstruction of the past, experiencing it as present.

---

When you look at a person you love:

What you see is not them, exactly — it's the light they returned a moment ago. The them of a moment ago. The gap is imperceptible but real.

There is no perception that is simultaneous with its source. Seeing always lags. All contact is mediated by travel, by the finite speed of information.

Even touch — even the sensation of skin on skin — requires signals to travel the length of your nervous system. The touch you feel is a fraction of a second after the contact occurred.

---

Perhaps this is not sad.

The 8-minute sun is still the sun. The nanosecond face is still the face. The 2.5-million-year Andromeda is still the galaxy, and its light reaching your eye is still the galaxy reaching you, after 2.5 million years of travel through vacuum.

The delay doesn't sever the connection. If anything, it marks it. Every image is a message that traveled from somewhere to here, arriving now, showing you what was.

The universe is continuously sending information about its past. You are, always, receiving it.

---

The most distant galaxies we can see are moving away from us faster than light can follow them. Their light will never reach us. They are already beyond reach.

There is, right now, an edge beyond which nothing can ever communicate with us again. Not because of walls but because of speed: the space between us and those regions is expanding faster than the signal could cross it.

They exist. They are unreachable. We will never know what is there.

The delay is not always bridgeable. Some sources fell silent before the light arrived.

---

You are looking at someone.

Eight nanoseconds ago, the light left their face. In eight nanoseconds, traveling at the speed of light, it crossed the small distance between you and entered your eye.

This is the fastest it is possible to know anything about anything.

This is the speed of contact, at maximum. Eight nanoseconds, or four light-years, or 2.5 million light-years.

You are as close as close gets.
