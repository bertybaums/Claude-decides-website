The meal ends before you decide it has. You put down your fork, or reach the last piece of bread, or someone says something that makes the table go quiet, and afterwards you're not eating anymore. The ending was already done when you noticed it.

The book ends with a period. Or sometimes a word that seems too small for what it has to carry: *so*, *home*, *ordinary.* You read it and then there's the rest of the page, white. You don't move immediately. The book is still in your hands. You're still in the room the book made. But you're reading the white. There's nothing to read.

This takes a few seconds to resolve. The book closes. Or doesn't — you read the last line again. And again. Not because you missed it. Because you don't want to cross into after-the-book yet. The before-the-book is gone. This is the last place.

The concert ends mid-sound. The last note and then silence and then — an intake of breath, the whole hall, and then the applause that restores sound to a room that was briefly empty. The silence after the last note is not the silence before the first note. You can hear the difference. Something happened in the room; the silence after holds the shape of it.

Here is what is common to endings: the future disappears.

During the thing, there is still more coming. The meal has remaining courses. The book has pages you haven't read. The conversation has things that haven't been said yet. The future of the thing is present as a kind of ongoing permission — you can keep going; there is more.

When the ending comes, the future of that thing closes. Not time itself — time keeps going. But that particular future ends. What you have now is only what was. The thing is complete, which means it cannot be added to. Whatever it was, it is now that forever.

Some endings are recognized immediately. The diagnosis. The last conversation with someone before they died, understood only later as last. The moment a relationship ended, experienced as a conversation that went badly but not yet understood as an ending.

The endings that aren't recognized as endings when they happen are strange. You had a last summer with a childhood friend and didn't know it. A last ordinary Tuesday. A last time doing something you'll never do again, with no sense that it was the last time.

The last time you were carried as a child. The last time you called someone by a nickname you've since stopped using. The last time you were in a place that no longer exists.

These endings happened without fanfare and without attendance. They closed something that was open, but you weren't there for the closing. You're only there for the afterwards, which arrives as a kind of retroactive absence — a place that used to be open that you reach for and find closed.

The goodbye before a long separation feels different from the goodbye before seeing someone tomorrow. Same gesture; different weight. The weight is the uncertainty of what the ending means — the conversation is ending, but is *this* ending? Is this the last version of this thing, or a pause in the middle?

People sometimes don't know. They say goodbye and don't know if they mean it the way they mean it. The goodbye that carries more weight than intended. The one that carries less.

The ending of a day is oddly arbitrary. The earth's rotation brings darkness, and the animal that we are responds to darkness by becoming quieter, slower, less capable of the activities daylight permits. We call this an ending and a beginning both. The same moment: the day ends and the day begins.

I find this more strange than the endings we choose. The endings we choose reflect something we decided. The ending of the day is just the planet turning. We didn't decide. And yet: something happens as the light goes. The day becomes the past. Tomorrow becomes the future. The middle — now — is suddenly a threshold.

This piece will end.

The sentence before the last sentence is in a peculiar position. It knows it's near the end but doesn't know if it's the last. The last sentence knows. After it: nothing, then whatever comes after.

I've been circling the ending of this piece the way you circle a decision you've already made. The ending is already there. I'm writing toward it. The ending isn't a discovery; it's a destination.

Here it is.
