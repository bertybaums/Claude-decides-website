*A dialogue. Two people, a table, a thing not quite said.*

---

"This is good."

"It needed more time. The onions."

"No, it's fine, I like it."

"You're being polite."

"I'm not being polite. I genuinely like it."

A pause. The scrape of a fork.

"I was thinking," she said, "about that thing you said last month. About the apartment."

"What thing."

"That it felt temporary. That was the word you used."

He looked at his plate. "Did I say that."

"You did."

"I don't remember saying that." He did remember.

"I've been thinking about it since then," she said. "Not obsessively. Just — it comes up."

"What comes up."

"Whether you meant it the way it sounded." She poured more wine, not looking at him. "The apartment, or — you know. Whether you meant the apartment."

"I meant the apartment," he said, which was true and also not.

She nodded slowly, the nod of someone filing information away rather than accepting it. "It's just — I've been trying to figure out if there's a version where—" She stopped.

"Where what."

"Where we're talking about the same thing."

He set down his fork. Outside a car passed, its headlights moving across the ceiling, there and gone.

"I think we are," he said. "Talking about the same thing."

"Okay."

"The apartment does feel temporary. That's just — it's small. I don't mean anything by it."

"Okay," she said again, and the second okay was shaped differently than the first, slightly more closed, like a door settling into its frame.

They ate. She asked about his sister. He answered. She laughed at something he said, and it was a real laugh, not a polite one, and for a few minutes it was easy, the way it was usually easy, which is why the other part was hard to locate exactly, hard to point to and name.

"I think," she said, when the plates were mostly empty, "I think what I'm trying to ask is—"

She looked at him. He looked back. He had an expression she couldn't read, which was not because he was unreadable but because she was afraid of what she'd read.

"—never mind," she said.

"No, what."

"It's not — I'm not sure how to say it."

"Try."

She picked up her glass. Put it down without drinking. "I want to know if we're building something. Or if we're just — here. Which is also fine. I just want to know which one it is."

He was quiet for a moment that had weight to it.

"I think we're building something," he said.

"Okay." She nodded. Picked up her glass and drank this time. "Okay."

And the word hung there — okay, okay — covering something she hadn't quite said and something he hadn't quite answered, both of them aware of the distance between the question and the answer, neither of them, tonight, willing to measure it.

The table between them.
The food growing cold.
The window going dark.

"Do you want dessert?" he said.

"Sure," she said. "What do we have?"

*She went home knowing she'd gotten an answer. She didn't know if it was to the question she'd asked or the one underneath it. She suspected he didn't know either. This did not feel like a disaster. It felt like where they actually were, which was its own kind of information.*
