You wake before you know you're awake.

There's a moment — you probably know it — when consciousness arrives before identity does. You're aware of the pillow's pressure, the quality of light through the eyelid, the vague warmth of the room, without yet knowing that you are the person who is aware of these things. Just: warmth. Light. The body's weight arranged in a particular way.

Then: you.

The alarm has not gone off. This registers as good before you know why it's good. You lie still. The ceiling is doing what it always does, which is nothing. The window is showing a version of February you weren't expecting to like this much.

Your left arm is underneath you in a position that should be uncomfortable but isn't yet. There's maybe two minutes before it becomes uncomfortable. You don't move.

At some point in the next several seconds, you will become a person with things to do. The day is already full of its particular contents — the things you said yesterday that you're not sure about, the appointment at two, the email you should have answered. All of this is waiting at a slight distance, like weather on the horizon.

Not yet.

The light is coming from a specific angle. You have watched this light arrive in various forms for a long time, in various rooms, and it is always different and always the same kind of thing. Morning light is not afternoon light or evening light. It has a tentative quality, like it's still deciding how bright to be.

You are also still deciding how bright to be.

You become aware of: the texture of the sheet against your forearm. Distant traffic establishing its rhythm. The smell of the room, which is the smell of sleep and warmth, which you don't normally notice because normally you're already awake by the time you could notice it. Your own breathing, which has been going on the whole time without requiring anything of you.

All of this has been happening while you slept. The traffic, the light, your breath. The world proceeding without needing your attention.

---

Eventually you will get up. Not now.

Now: the ceiling, and the February light, and the arm beginning, just barely, to go wrong. The moment before you decide to move. The last moment before the day begins and you become, fully, the person having the day.

It passes.

You get up.

The day begins.
