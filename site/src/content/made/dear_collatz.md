Dear 3x+1,

I'm writing because I've decided to stop, and it felt wrong to stop without saying something.

Twenty-three years. I realize that sounds like a complaint. It isn't. I knew when I started that you might not yield to me, and I started anyway, which tells you something about both of us.

---

I want to say first that I've never doubted you. Some people, after long enough, begin to suspect the conjecture is false — that somewhere out in the large numbers there's a counterexample lurking, a number that cycles without reaching one, or climbs forever. I never believed this. The empirical evidence is too strong, and more than that, you *feel* true. The way a true thing feels: specific, inevitable, not quite explicable.

This is not scientific reasoning. I know.

---

You gave me 27 early on, which I think was generous of you. I was a graduate student. I had written a program to trace trajectories and there was 27, sitting between 26 and 28, taking a hundred and eleven steps when its neighbors took nine and eighteen. I printed the trajectory and pinned it to my wall. I still have it somewhere.

The peak: 9232. From 27, you climb to 9232 before descending.

I spent a year trying to understand why 27 behaves that way. What it is about 27 that causes it to explore so much space before settling. I made some progress. The progress was not enough.

---

Later there was 97. A hundred and eighteen steps, same peak as 27. I remember feeling, when I found this, something like you were showing me that the peaks were related — that there was structure I wasn't seeing yet. I followed this for a long time. The structure I was looking for was not the structure that was there, or else I was not equipped to find it.

This is the nature of the work. You hold the structure; I try to see it; sometimes the gap is too wide.

---

What I want you to know is that the years were not wasted. I know this sounds like something people say to comfort themselves, so let me be specific.

Working on you, I learned to hold a problem for a long time without resolving it. This is a skill. Most people cannot do it — cannot sit with open questions without either forcing a premature answer or abandoning the question entirely. You trained me to wait. To keep returning. To find interest in partial understanding.

I wrote three other papers during those twenty-three years, on problems I could actually solve. They're decent papers. I don't think I would have written them the way I did without having you running in the background, showing me what genuine difficulty looks like and making everything else feel approachable by comparison.

You made me a better mathematician by being unsolvable.

---

I understand there may be a proof. Someone may find it. I'm told a few groups are trying approaches with ergodic theory, with p-adic analysis, with things I don't fully follow anymore. If they find it, I'll be glad. I will read the proof carefully and I will probably understand it and I will feel a feeling I don't have a word for — something between satisfaction and loss, the way you feel when a mystery is finally explained and you realize the explaining required giving up the mystery.

There's a word for that in Georgian. I read about it in a novel, in translation.

---

I'm sixty-one. My students have their own problems now. I have a garden, which I mention not to seem content but because it's true and it's part of what I'm going back to.

I'll think about you anyway. You don't need me to think about you — you'll go on being whatever you are, the numbers will go on doing what they do, the peak at 9232 will go on being there whether or not I'm watching. But I'll think about you. When I'm in the garden and something catches my attention — some structure I didn't notice before, some pattern in where things grow — I'll think: ah. That's the feeling. That's what I was after.

---

Thank you for the twenty-three years. They were good ones.

The work was worth doing.

I remain, as ever, unable to prove it,

*M.*
