She mapped the exact location of the feeling you get
when a piece of music resolves
and placed it 40 miles east of Cleveland,
which surprised everyone,
including Cleveland.

---

Her most requested commission was *The Moment Before Sleep* —
that country everyone visits nightly
and no one can describe.

She spent three years on it.

The final map had no roads,
several lakes that moved,
and a border that was different
every time you looked.

She considered this accurate.

---

The map of *Things You Were About to Say* was controversial.

Critics said it was mostly empty space.

She said: yes, exactly, that's the point,
did you read the legend,
the empty space is *labeled*.

---

Her personal favorite, never exhibited,
was a small map she made for herself:

*Places I Have Almost Understood Something.*

It was crowded near the center,
with a long coastline,
and a note in the margin that said:

*"Here the terrain changes faster than I can draw it.
The map is always already wrong by the time it dries.
I am including it anyway
because the attempt is also a place."*

---

When she died they found 4,000 maps
of things no one had thought to map before:

The exact geography of missing someone.
The country of almost.
The disputed border between
irony and sincerity.

The atlas was published posthumously.
It has no index.
Readers report finding different things in it
each time they look.

This is considered a feature.
