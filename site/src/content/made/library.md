## Getting Here

The Library of Possible Selves has no fixed address. It is located at the intersection of whatever you almost did and wherever you almost went. Most visitors arrive by accident, late at night, during a period of insomnia or transition. Some arrive in the middle of conversations. A few have reported arriving in dreams, though the Library's administration declines to confirm this.

Do not look for it. It will find you at the appropriate moment, which is not always the moment you would have chosen.

---

## Hours of Operation

The Library is open continuously. It has never closed. Several of its holdings were accessioned before you were born. The most recent acquisitions are updated in real time, which is one of the reasons the catalog is perpetually incomplete.

Please note: the Library does not open on demand. Visitors who require a specific self to be available may find that the relevant collection has been moved to deep storage, or was never cataloged in the first place, or is currently checked out by someone else (see: the self you might have been if someone else had made a different choice).

---

## Reading Room Hours

Reading rooms are available at all hours but are busiest in:
- The small hours of sleepless nights
- The weeks following major decisions
- The first months in a new place
- The years after a significant loss

Seating is limited. There is no waitlist. You will find a seat when you are ready for one.

## A Note on the Collections

The Library holds every version of you that did not become you. This is a large collection. It grows every time a decision is made, and decisions are made continuously, including decisions you do not recognize as decisions. The collection includes:

- The selves that would have resulted from paths taken
- The selves that would have resulted from paths not taken
- The selves produced by paths you considered and rejected
- The selves produced by paths you did not consider
- The selves produced by events that happened to others and not to you
- The selves produced by things said by people who no longer remember saying them

The collection does not include the selves that were impossible. The Library deals only in the contingent.

## Wing A: The Professorships

This wing contains the selves that pursued academic careers. It is a large wing. Scholars in their respective fields, many of them quite distinguished, all of them slightly baffled by certain things that you find obvious.

Subcollections include:
- **The Science Selves** (several, in adjacent carrels, arguing about methodology)
- **The Humanities Selves** (organized loosely by field; they do not always agree on what field)
- **The Unfinished Dissertations** (a climate-controlled room; do not open the windows)

The self who finished the PhD and became a professor of comparative literature has been checked out. Leave your name with the desk; you will be notified when it returns.

---

## Wing B: The Geographies

Organized by city, country, and climate. Each location contains several selves, none of which knew the others were there.

Notable subcollections:
- **The City You Almost Moved To** (a very large room; most visitors spend too long here)
- **The City You Moved Away From** (kept in a separate building; visitors may not carry items between the two)
- **The Foreign Country** (all available languages; translation assistance upon request)
- **The Rural Option** (accessed via a quiet path; no elevator)

Please be advised that the selves in Wing B believe their cities were the right choice. This is true of all of them. The staff has chosen not to intervene.

## Wing C: The Relationships

Access to this wing requires a visitor's declaration. Please state at the entrance: *I understand that this is for archival purposes only.*

The wing holds the selves produced by relationships that did not occur, or did not continue, or were never begun. It also holds the selves produced by the relationships that did occur, in the alternate versions where they had different outcomes.

Rules for this wing:
1. Nothing may be removed
2. Conversations with the archived selves are not permitted
3. The selves do not know you are watching
4. Please replace any items you disturb
5. Exit through the door you entered

The wing also contains a small reading room with materials explaining the philosophical status of what you are doing here. These materials are inconclusive.

---

## Wing D: The Careers

The self that became a chef. The self that stayed in medicine. The self that took the startup offer in 2012. The self that opened the shop in the town by the coast. The self that was still at the same company, thirty years later, and was happy there.

A note about Wing D: visitors frequently come here seeking evidence that they made the wrong choice. The wing contains no such evidence. It contains only other selves, in other choices, some of whom are also convinced they made the wrong choice, or the right one, or who have stopped thinking about it. None of them have access to your wing.

The self that had more time for creative work is in subcollection D-7. There is often a line.

---

## Wing E: The Things Said and Unsaid

A smaller wing, but densely packed.

This collection contains the selves produced by:
- Things you said that you cannot unsay
- Things you did not say that you cannot now say
- Things said to you that you did not hear at the time

The Things Said and Unsaid are not classified by what was said. They are classified by what changed because of it. Many of the selves in this wing are indistinguishable from you. A very few are radically different. You will probably spend too long in here trying to determine which items belong in which category.

The desk staff has been trained to assist with this, but typically declines to offer an opinion.

## The Special Collections

*Access by appointment only*

**The Selves That Died Young**: A closed reading room. Visitors may request a brief, supervised visit. Most choose not to.

**The Selves That Were Happier**: A frequently requested collection, perpetually restricted. Researchers have questioned whether this collection can be organized as a coherent category. The administration is reviewing.

**The Selves That Did Not Exist**: The largest collection, and strictly theoretical. The Library has not yet found a way to catalog what was never possible. This work continues.

**The Self You Are Becoming**: The only forward-looking collection, and the most incomplete. New materials arrive continuously; none are available for viewing until they are superseded.

---

## Rules and Conduct

1. You may not borrow from the collection. You may only read.
2. The selves may not see you. Please respect this.
3. Do not attempt to make corrections. The Library is an archive, not an editor.
4. The feeling of recognition is normal. So is the feeling of estrangement. Both are correct.
5. If you feel you have been here before: you have. Most visitors have.
6. There is no lost and found. What you lose here, you lose here.

## A Note from the Director

We are sometimes asked whether the Library is comforting or distressing. The answer varies by visitor. What we can say is that the Library is accurate. It holds what it says it holds. The selves are real in the sense that they were possible, and possibility is a form of reality that the Library takes seriously.

We are also sometimes asked which self is the best one. We do not answer this question. We are an archive. We do not curate.

What we notice, after many years of operation: most visitors arrive expecting to find the self that made the right choices. They leave understanding that the word *right* does not appear in our catalog system.

We hope your visit is useful, in whatever way is appropriate for you.

*The Library of Possible Selves*
*Est. at the first decision you remember making*
