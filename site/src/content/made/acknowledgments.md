*The author wishes to thank the following for their contributions to a book that does not exist.*

---

The author owes an unpayable debt to **the several thousand mornings** that were not wasted, some of which produced the material that would have been in this book, and to the smaller number of mornings that were wasted, which turned out also to be necessary.

**The particular café on the corner** deserves specific mention. The author spent many hours there between 2019 and 2022. The proprietors never asked what the author was working on. This restraint, unrecognized at the time, was essential.

The author is grateful to **the first draft**, which was wrong in ways that were instructive, and to **the second draft**, which was wrong in ways that were less instructive but more humbling, and to **the third draft**, which was abandoned approximately sixty percent of the way through for reasons that still seem justified but may not be.

A profound thanks to **the people who read chapters and said they were good when they were not**, whose encouragement made it possible to continue at a time when honest feedback would have stopped the project entirely. And to **the people who read chapters and said they were not good when they were**, whose honesty came later but was ultimately more useful.

To **the specific song** that the author played approximately eight hundred times during the writing of a chapter that did not survive into the final version: it wasn't the song's fault.

The author is grateful to **the three-week period in October 2021** during which the argument of the book clarified itself unexpectedly, and to the argument itself, which was more patient than expected and arrived without fanfare, during a walk, on a Tuesday that had not seemed significant.

An acknowledgment is owed to **the people whose conversations became parts of this book without their knowledge or consent**. They will not recognize themselves in the text, which protects everyone. But the conversations happened, and they changed the thinking, and there is no honest way to write a book without tracking what you owe to conversations you cannot cite.

The author is grateful to **the editor** who would have improved this book, and to the **copyeditor** who would have found the errors, and to the **indexer** who would have made the connections visible in a form the author could not have produced alone. They were not needed. They are thanked anyway.

A debt is owed to **the books that made this book possible** — the ones that were read for this project and the ones that were read long before there was a project, in the ordinary way of reading things without purpose, which is the most useful kind of reading. The specific books are not listed here. The reader will know some of them and not know others, and both conditions are fine.

To **the period of not writing**: the author did not enjoy it and believes now, with more conviction than before, that it was not necessary. The author acknowledges this may be wrong.

The author is grateful to **three separate people** who each, independently, in different years, said a version of the same thing, which was: *you should write this down*. They meant different things. The author wrote different things down in response to each. One of those things became something close to this book. The author cannot reconstruct which conversation led to which decision, and the uncertainty is not uncomfortable.

An acknowledgment, offered without irony, to **the thing this book was trying to say** and its patience with the various things the book said instead. The original thing may not be recoverable. What replaced it is better in some ways and worse in others, which is what usually happens.

To **the years this took**: the author accepts them.

The usual statement appears here: *any errors that remain are the author's own*. This is always true and never quite sufficient. The errors that remain are not the only ones. Some errors were removed and should have stayed. Some were removed and should have been removed earlier. Some are not legible as errors yet and will be in ten years.

This, too, is what usually happens.

*The author thanks you for reading this far.*
*This is the last page before the book would have begun.*
