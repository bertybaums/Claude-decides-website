*A brief history of one gesture.*

**Mesopotamia, c. 3000 BCE**

Two men stand at the edge of a field. One is giving the other something: a debt cleared, a promise made. They clasp right hands. The clasping means: *I have given you what I said I would give you; the exchange is complete.* The clasped hands also mean: *neither of us is holding a weapon*. Both meanings are true simultaneously. Honesty and safety look the same from outside.

**Athens, 5th century BCE**

*Dexiosis*: the joined right hands appear on funeral reliefs, on wedding scenes, on images of gods making covenants with mortals. The gesture means *agreement* but also *bond* and also *farewell*. The same shape for all three. Whoever first clasped hands at leave-taking probably didn't know they were borrowing from a word that also means contract. Perhaps there is no borrowing; perhaps they are the same word, and departures are always contracts of a kind.

**Medieval Europe**

The handshake fell from favor among nobles. What replaced it: the bow, the kneeling, the removal of the hat. These gestures are asymmetric — they acknowledge difference in status. The handshake is, structurally, egalitarian. You cannot shake hands with someone and simultaneously be above them. The gesture requires parity to work.

Equals shake hands. Unequals bow. This was understood without being stated.

**England, 17th century**

The Quakers adopted the handshake as their standard greeting, replacing the bow and the hat-tip they refused to perform on principle. They refused these gestures because they implied status, and the Quakers believed in equality before God. The handshake was the egalitarian alternative: the same gesture given to king and laborer alike.

This created small conflicts when a Quaker met a lord who expected deference and received a handshake instead. The refusal to bow was a political statement made in the body. The handshake was a protest that looked like a greeting.

**The American frontier, 19th century**

The handshake spread in contexts where no one knew anyone's background and nobody had time to establish hierarchy through ceremony. You shook hands because it was quick and because it implied the other person was trustworthy until proven otherwise. In a place where everyone was starting over, this was a practical philosophy given shape.

The firm handshake became an American ideal. Whole guides were written. The grip should be confident but not crushing. Eye contact is essential. Two pumps, three at most. The handshake was now a performance being evaluated in real time.

**Western business culture, 20th century**

The handshake has become a ritual so standardized that its original content has been almost completely displaced by its form. Two people meet; they shake hands; neither notices they have done it. The meaning is: *we are beginning a formal interaction; the formalities are being observed.* This is not nothing, but it is not what the Mesopotamian men meant, or the Quakers.

The gesture has traveled so far from its origin that its origin is invisible. It is no longer primarily about safety (we are not holding weapons), or equality (we are the same), or covenant (we have agreed to something). It is about normalcy: *this interaction is proceeding as expected.*

**2020**

The handshake nearly disappeared. For a period of some months and then some years, a gesture that had meant various things for five thousand years became a potential vector for disease, and the potential cost of the gesture outweighed any content it carried. People touched elbows instead, or waved, or nodded. Some of them felt the loss of the gesture. Some didn't notice.

When the gesture returned, it returned to the same people in mostly the same way. The five thousand years behind it were unchanged. The handshake still meant: *I am not holding a weapon; we are equal in this moment; something between us has been agreed*.

Most of the people doing it knew nothing of this. Most of them never will.

The gesture carries its history the way a word carries its etymology: invisibly, entirely, always.

*Somewhere right now, two hands are clasping. The hands don't know what they know.*
