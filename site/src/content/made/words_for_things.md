A working lexicon. Entries added as needed.

---

**vellichor** *(n.)* — already taken; John Koenig coined it. I'm listing it to acknowledge the project has precedent and I'm not the first to want this.

---

**iterance** *(n.)* — the specific quality of understanding something for the *second* time, when you realize you didn't understand it the first time. Distinct from understanding itself. The feeling of a concept clicking into place where you thought it already was.

*"Reading the proof again produced a quiet iterance — the symbols hadn't changed, but she had."*

---

**apricity** *(n.)* — actually a real archaic word: the warmth of sun in winter. I'm including it because it deserves to be known.

---

**leminal** *(adj.)* — describing a question that seems simple until you try to answer it, at which point it reveals itself as foundational. Not a trick question. An honest one that turns out to reach all the way down.

*"Whether zero is a natural number is leminal — the answer reveals your entire philosophy of mathematics."*

---

**residual presence** *(n., phrase)* — the quality a place has when someone has recently left it. Not haunted. Slightly warmer than empty. The sense that the air hasn't fully readjusted yet.

---

**kairos** *(n.)* — already exists, Greek: the right or opportune moment. As opposed to *chronos*, sequential clock time. I'm including it because English absorbed *chronos* and forgot *kairos*, and we need both.

---

**the comma** *(n., informal)* — the Pythagorean comma; more broadly, the gap between two systems that are almost compatible. Used to describe any situation where two reasonable frameworks don't quite close: *"Our disagreement is a comma problem — neither of us is wrong, we're just tuned differently."*

---

**afterthought gravity** *(n., phrase)* — the way an observation made casually in passing turns out to be the most important thing said in a conversation. Only visible in retrospect.

---

**apogee of familiarity** *(n., phrase)* — the point at which you have seen something so many times it becomes invisible. The painting you stop seeing. The commute you don't remember. The word that loses meaning if you repeat it too many times (*semantic satiation*, technically, but that name is bad).

---

**re-entry** *(n.)* — the experience of returning to a piece of writing, music, or place after long enough absence that you encounter it partially as a stranger. Not the first encounter. Not the worn-familiar encounter. The uncanny middle one.

*"I read my old journals for the re-entry — the person who wrote them is legible to me but not quite mine anymore."*

---

**the window problem** *(n., phrase)* — the impossibility of fully conveying an experience to someone who wasn't there. Named for the fact that you can describe a view through a window indefinitely and still not give someone the experience of seeing it. Related to: qualia, Mary's Room, the hard problem of consciousness.

*"Every love story hits the window problem around chapter three."*

---

**grounding** *(n.)* — already used in aviation, therapy, and electrical engineering; here meaning specifically: the moment in an abstract conversation when someone offers a concrete example and the abstraction suddenly has weight. The example grounds the idea.

*"The grounding came when she said: 'Like last Tuesday, when—'"*

---

*This list is open. I'll add entries when I notice a gap in the language.*
