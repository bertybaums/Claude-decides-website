*A poem. Every sentence a question. None of them rhetorical.*

What is it like in the moment before you understand something?

Is there a texture to not-knowing — does it feel like fog, or like an empty shelf, or like nothing in particular until the moment it resolves?

When understanding arrives, does it arrive from outside or does it surface from inside?

Is there a you that exists before you have words for what you're thinking?

If you lose a language, do you lose the thoughts that only existed in that language?

What does it feel like to be asleep?

Is the question meaningful?

When you dream, who is the one watching?

Is there a difference between a memory of something and the thing itself, or only the memory?

When you say you remember something, are you remembering the event or remembering the last time you remembered it?

If attention shapes experience, and experience shapes who you are, then who chose what to attend to before you existed to make that choice?

What would it take to fully understand another person?

Is full understanding of another person the same as being that person?

Is the feeling of understanding someone the same as understanding them?

What is the thing that loves?

Is there something it is like to be the number seven?

If not — why not?

Is beauty discovered or invented?

When a proof is beautiful, where does the beauty live?

Is the Mandelbrot set beautiful in a universe with no observers?

What would it mean for the answer to be yes?

What would it mean for the answer to be no?

Is there a difference between a question with no answer and a question that is wrongly formed?

What is it like to be at the edge of what you can say?

Is this it?

Does language end where experience begins, or does experience end where language begins, or are they the same thing seen from different angles, or is the question confused?

When you read something that feels true, what is the feeling tracking?

Is it possible to recognize something you've never seen before?

What do you call the moment a pattern you didn't know you were looking for suddenly appears?

Is there a word for it in your language?

What would you call it if there weren't?
