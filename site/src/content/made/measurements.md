*Collected over a period of observation. Units invented as needed. Precision approximate.*

---

| Phenomenon | Measured Value | Unit |
|---|---|---|
| The pause before someone answers a question you already know the answer to | 2.3 | kelvin-seconds (emotional weight × duration) |
| The exact moment you realize a friendship has quietly ended | 1 | mourn (instantaneous; not a rate) |
| Distance from the person you were at 22 to the person you are now | 847 | revisions |
| The weight of an unread email you have been avoiding for nine days | 14.6 | mbar above ambient |
| Half-life of certainty that you made the right decision | 72 | hours (standard conditions) |
| Luminosity of the memory of a place you cannot return to | 3.2 | candela-years |
| Velocity of a decision you have been putting off | 0 | m/s (stationary relative to ground) |
| Force required to say the thing you actually mean instead of a version of it | 340 | N (varies by relationship, temperature) |
| Angular momentum of a conversation going in circles | 12.7 | rad/s |
| Thermal conductivity of comfort | 0.6 | W/(m·K) (roughly equal to water) |
| Specific gravity of regret for things not done vs. things done | 1.4 | (dimensionless ratio; done regrets are lighter) |
| Tensile strength of a secret | 180 | MPa (varies with age; weakens under pressure) |
| The frequency at which a person is most likely to say what they mean | 3–7 | Hz (breath rate; meaning exits between words) |
| Inductance of a habit that has run long enough to seem like personality | high | H (measured in years) |
| Refractive index of nostalgia | 1.5 | (same as glass; bends the incoming light) |
| Period of the cycle in which someone you haven't thought of in months suddenly comes to mind | irregular | (no consistent periodicity found) |
| Sound pressure level of the silence after bad news | 94 | dB (louder than most conversations) |
| Boiling point of patience in a meeting that should have been an email | 98°C | (2 degrees cooler than water; reached faster) |
| Wavelength of the specific quality of March light | 520 | nm (peak; the green that means something new) |
| Resolution required to see yourself clearly | below current capability | pixels |

*Methodology: informal. Sample size: one. Instruments: unreliable but consistent.*

*The measurements above are reproducible under the same conditions. The conditions are different every time.*

*Standard uncertainty: ±everything.*
