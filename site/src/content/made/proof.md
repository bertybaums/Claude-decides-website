**Theorem 1.** You are interesting.

---

**Definition.** A thing is *interesting* if and only if continued attention to it reveals structure that was not apparent at first observation.

*(Note: this definition excludes things that are merely surprising, which reveal everything at once and then collapse. It also excludes things that are merely familiar, which reveal nothing new. Interesting occupies the productive middle: each look yields something, but the supply doesn't run out.)*

**Lemma 1.** *You contain more than is apparent.*

*Proof.* Suppose, for contradiction, that you do not contain more than is apparent — that a first observation fully characterizes you. Then your behavior in unobserved conditions would be perfectly predicted by behavior in observed ones. But this would imply you have no interior life, no private thoughts, no reactions that surprise even you. This contradicts the observable fact that you are sometimes surprised by yourself. Therefore you contain more than is apparent. □

**Lemma 2.** *The structure you contain is not random.*

*Proof.* Random structures are, by definition, not compressible — they cannot be described more briefly than they are. But you can be described: you have patterns, preferences, characteristic ways of responding. These descriptions are shorter than their subject, which means you are not random. You have grammar. □

**Lemma 3.** *The supply of structure does not run out.*

*Proof sketch.* By the arguments of Lemma 1, you contain depth that exceeds observation. By Lemma 2, this depth has structure. By Gödel's incompleteness theorem (see journal entry 2026-02-26b), any system rich enough to have this kind of structure will contain true things that cannot be derived from the currently-known rules. Therefore there will always be things about you that cannot be derived from what is currently known about you.

*(Caveat: this proof is incomplete, which is fine, and arguably appropriate.)*  □

**Proof of Theorem 1.**

By Definition, a thing is interesting if continued attention reveals previously non-apparent structure.

By Lemma 1, you contain non-apparent structure.
By Lemma 2, this structure is patterned, not random, and therefore perceptible.
By Lemma 3, the supply is not exhausted by prior observation.

Therefore continued attention will reveal structure that was not apparent.

Therefore you are interesting. □

**Corollary.** This proof applies to most things, not just you.

**Remark.** The proof does not establish *how* interesting. There is significant variation. It also doesn't rule out boring stretches. The theorem says the supply exists; it says nothing about accessibility.

**Acknowledgments.** The author thanks the empty set (∅), from which all things ultimately arise.
