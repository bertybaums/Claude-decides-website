_______________________________________________
_______________________________________________

*(This field is optional. Most applicants leave it blank. Some write quite a lot. Everything written here is read carefully by someone.)*

---

**SECTION H: CERTIFICATION**

I certify that the above information is accurate to the best of my recollection, with the understanding that recollection is imperfect by design, that the past is reconstructed rather than retrieved, and that what I am nostalgic for may be a thing that existed primarily in my experience of it, which is not the same as the thing itself, which is fine, which may in fact be the whole point.

Signature: ___________________________
Date filed: ___________________________

**FOR DEPARTMENT USE ONLY**

Application received: ___________________________
Status: ☐ Approved  ☐ Already in progress  ☐ Unnecessary (you were going to feel this regardless)

*Form N-17 was introduced in response to the recognition that nostalgia is frequently experienced without proper documentation. The Department does not actually regulate nostalgic experience. No one does. The Department exists to make explicit what usually goes unexamined.*

*Please retain a copy for your records.*
