## Day 1 (Approximate)

**Morning:**
Arrival at a situation you did not choose. Note the customs. Note what is expected. Begin acquiring the language, which you will not finish acquiring for several years, by which time the language will have become so natural you will no longer notice you are speaking it.

Note: you will not know, on this day, that this is the beginning of the phase you will later call significant. This is always how it works.

**Afternoon:**
Free time. This time is not actually free but will later be remembered as such.

**Evening:**
The first encounter with something that doesn't fit the map. The map will need revision. This will be noted and then not revised immediately.

---

## Day 2 through Year 3 (Approximate)

*These days have been condensed in the itinerary for clarity.*

Significant experiences, whose significance will mostly be apparent only later. Some experiences whose significance will become apparent on the day. A few experiences that will never entirely be explained.

Meals. Many meals. The meals are not listed individually. In retrospect, the meals will be more present than many of the listed experiences. Note this.

Several conversations that changed the direction of things. You will not know, during most of these conversations, that they are conversation of this type.

One night (unscheduled) that counts as two years of living.

## The Middle Section

Duration: variable. May feel longer or shorter than it is.

**What to expect:**
You will know more than you did. This will not produce the clarity you expected it to produce. The additional knowledge will mostly reveal what you still don't know.

You will find that several things you believed were true are not, and several things you doubted are. The revisions are not complete. They are ongoing.

You will encounter others at various stages of their own journeys. Some will be further along. Some will be earlier. The itinerary does not specify which is more enviable.

**Recommended:** Some amount of noticing the place you are in, which is where you are, not where you are going.

## The Point Where You Realize Something

*This stop is not always scheduled but almost always occurs.*

At some point in the journey — and the timing is variable — there will be a recognition. It is not always dramatic. It may occur while washing dishes. It may occur on a Tuesday.

What is recognized: usually some version of what was true the whole time, which you were not ready to see until now.

What to do with the recognition: carry it. The journey continues from this point.

**Duration of stop:** Approximately fifteen seconds to several years, depending on the recognition.

---

## The Parts That Can't Be Planned For

A loss. Possibly more than one.

A change in what you want, occurring without your permission.

Something given to you that you didn't know you needed, from a direction you weren't watching.

Something you gave away that turned out to be important. Not the thing you thought was important. A different thing.

A place that matters. There will be a specific place. You will know it when you get there.

---

## Toward the End

*The itinerary becomes less specific here.*

You will have, by this point, a considerable amount of time that is behind you. The relationship to this time will change. It will first seem like loss. Then accumulation. Then, if you're lucky, something more like landscape — something you can see from where you stand.

The destination, at this point, will be less important than originally thought.

What will be more important than originally thought: the people who were on the journey at the same time. This is almost universally reported by experienced travelers and almost universally underestimated at departure.

**Note on what is remembered:** Not what you carried. Not the places. Mostly the moments when you were not alone, and fully present, and knew it.

---

## Destination

The destination is not specified in advance.

This is not a flaw in the itinerary. It is the nature of this journey.

All itineraries for this journey end at the same place. The place has no name on this map. The journey is the destination, in the sense that the journey is what actually happened.

What you were going toward: this. Here. Now.
