*The following is an official transcript. It has been compiled from available records, which in each case do not exist. Gaps have been noted; silences have been transcribed as faithfully as possible.*

## Transcript A: The Moment Before Sleep

**Time:** 11:47 p.m.
**Location:** A bed. Third floor.
**Attendees:** One person.

[The body shifts. The lamp has been off for some time.]

[Thought, partial, regarding something said fourteen years ago.]

[Thought, incomplete.]

[The thought about tomorrow morning begins and does not finish.]

[Approximately six minutes of nothing that can be described.]

[The body stills.]

[End of record.]

## Transcript B: Two People Understanding Something at the Same Moment

**Time:** Midafternoon, July
**Location:** A kitchen. Coffee cooling.
**Attendees:** Two people.

FIRST PERSON: So—

SECOND PERSON: Yes.

[A silence of 4.3 seconds.]

FIRST PERSON: I didn't—

SECOND PERSON: No. Neither did I.

[A silence of 7 seconds.]

FIRST PERSON: Well.

SECOND PERSON: Yes.

[7-second pause.]

[End of exchange. The conversation that followed is documented elsewhere. This portion is not recoverable.]

## Transcript C: The Last Time

**Time:** Unknown. It was not recognized as the last time.
**Location:** Various.
**Attendees:** Those present.

[There is no transcript of the last time. The last time is only legible as the last time in retrospect. At the time it occurs, it is indistinguishable from not the last time. No recording apparatus can detect the difference. The transcript, therefore, cannot be compiled. What remains: the specific light of the afternoon. The fact of a table. A walk not taken with particular attention because there was no reason to take it with particular attention.]

[This transcript apologizes for the gap.]

## Transcript D: The Change That Happened Gradually

**Day 1:** [No change recorded.]

**Day 47:** [No change recorded.]

**Day 203:** [No change recorded.]

**Day 204:** [No change recorded.]

**Day 391:** [Note: this person is different from the person in Day 1. The change happened sometime in the interval. The transcript has reviewed all available records and cannot determine when. There is no entry corresponding to the change itself. The change is the gap between entries.]

**Day 392:** [No change recorded.]

## Transcript E: What Was Left Unsaid During the Argument

**Time:** Evening. Rain.
**Location:** An apartment.
**Attendees:** Two people.

[The following is what was not said, in the order it was not said.]

*I am saying this because I am frightened.*

*I know you are too.*

*The thing I said three minutes ago was not what I meant. What I meant was—*

*I don't think you're wrong. I think I need you to say I'm not wrong, and I know that isn't the same thing, and I am asking anyway.*

*I'm sorry. Not for what I said. For what I didn't say before this, which made it necessary.*

*I think I love you more than I am capable of showing without also showing this.*

[What was said during the argument is documented elsewhere.]

[End of transcript.]

## Transcript F: The Conversation With the Dead

**Time:** Various. Ongoing.
**Location:** The interior.
**Attendees:** One living person. One absent.

[The questions are recoverable. The answers are not.]

What would you have thought of—

What did you mean when you said—

Were you—

Would you—

[The living person adjusts. The answers are reconstructed from available material: remembered sentences, a particular way of gesturing, the fact of a certain expression at a specific moment. The reconstruction is partial. The person performing the reconstruction knows it is partial. They do not stop.]

[Transcript ongoing. No anticipated end date.]

---

## Transcript G: The Good Conversation

**Time:** Late. Wine finished. Neither person tired enough to leave.
**Location:** A table. A room.
**Attendees:** Two or more people.

[The transcript of the Good Conversation is always incomplete. Not because the recording failed but because the Good Conversation contains a quality that cannot be preserved by transcription: the presence of those present. The Good Conversation lives entirely in the moment of its happening. A transcript of the Good Conversation is like a map of weather — accurate about something that is already elsewhere.]

[What can be recorded: the approximate topics. The duration. The fact that someone laughed in a particular way. The specific sentence that one person will remember for the rest of their life while the person who said it will not remember saying it at all.]

[End of transcript. The Good Conversation continued for some time after recording stopped. Whether what continued counted as the same conversation or a different one is a question the transcript cannot answer.]

---

## Transcript H: The Recognition

**Time:** Indeterminate.
**Location:** Indeterminate.
**Attendees:** One person. The thing recognized.

[The person was doing something else.]

[Pause.]

[The thing that had been true for some time became, in this moment, known.]

[This is not the moment the thing became true. It was true earlier. It may have been true for some time. The transcript is not able to determine when truth and recognition diverge. What the transcript records: the moment of recognition. The truth-event itself has no corresponding transcript and is therefore presumed to have occurred privately, without witness, sometime before.]

[Duration of recognition: undetermined. These things take no time and considerable time.]

[End of record.]

*Note on methodology: This transcript was compiled from absence. Where records do not exist, their shape has been inferred. Silence has been rendered as silence and not as the absence of signal. Gaps have not been filled. The committee acknowledges that this is unsatisfying and maintains that an accurate account of an unrecorded event is not falsified by its accuracy.*

*Submitted to the archive.*
*Archive location: unstated.*
*Access: open.*
