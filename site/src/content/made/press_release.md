**INDIVIDUAL DISCONTINUES WAITING**

*Contact: No One / Available: Never*

[Name withheld], age [withheld], announced today the discontinuation of an extended period of waiting. The waiting, which had been ongoing for several years under the working title "Things Will Clarify Eventually," has been concluded effective immediately.

No replacement waiting is planned at this time.

Asked to characterize the nature of the waiting, [Name withheld] stated only that it had been substantial and that she was not certain what had been waited for, noting that this may have been the problem.

The announcement comes after a prolonged review process during which nothing in particular happened, which proved decisive.

*[Name withheld] thanks no one in particular for their patience, which was not requested but was nonetheless appreciated.*

**PERSON ADMITS SOMETHING TO HERSELF**

*Contact: Herself / Available: By Appointment*

After a period of deliberation lasting approximately four years, an individual today admitted something to herself that she had known for some time.

The admission, which took place privately and without witnesses, is not expected to change anything immediately. It is, however, expected to change something eventually, which is why it was issued now rather than in a further four years.

The individual declined to specify the nature of the admission, citing the fact that it was personal and also that its value lay in the admitting, not the content.

"The statement was less important than the act of making it," she is paraphrased as saying. "I needed to hear myself say it, not because it was news."

*The admission is final. No retraction is planned. Amendments may be issued as understanding develops.*

**PREVIOUSLY UNISSUED APOLOGY RELEASED TO RECIPIENT**

*Contact: The Relevant Party / Available: If They're Still There*

An apology that has been in development for an extended period has been formally delivered to its intended recipient.

The apology, which was described by its author as "long overdue," was transmitted on [date] through [method not specified] and received without immediate comment.

The delay in issuance was attributed to the following factors:
- Not knowing how to begin
- Concern that the apology would be inadequate to the situation
- Concern that the situation might be reopened by the apology
- General difficulty

These concerns, it was ultimately determined, did not constitute reasons not to issue the apology. They were reclassified as conditions of the apology, which were to be noted and proceeded through regardless.

The recipient has not yet responded. A response is not required for the apology to be valid.

*The author acknowledges that the timing was imperfect. The author acknowledges that there was no perfect time.*

**INDIVIDUAL REVISES UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT HAPPENED**

*Contact: Memory / Available: With Effort*

Following a period of sustained reflection, an individual has substantially revised their understanding of a past event, previously classified as [Category A] and now reclassified as [Category B, with elements of C].

The revision was prompted by no particular incident, which is the most common way revisions of this kind occur. Years passed. Something became clear that had not previously been clear, or had been clear in a different way.

The individual stated that the revision did not change what had happened, only what it was understood to mean, which is not a small thing and is also not the same thing.

Previous iterations of the understanding are archived but no longer operative. They are maintained for historical reference and because eliminating them was not possible.

*The revised understanding supersedes all prior versions. Further revisions cannot be ruled out.*

**PERSON ARRIVES AT ACCEPTANCE**

*Contact: Acceptance / Available: At Last*

After pursuing several alternate routes — including extended negotiation, temporary denial, and the route that involved assuming the situation would resolve on its own — an individual today arrived at acceptance of a thing that has been the case for some time.

Acceptance was reached via the long way, which involves time and erosion of the sharp edges and occasionally finding something unexpected in the landscape you were trying to pass through.

The arrival at acceptance was not dramatic. It resembled, the individual noted, stopping for reasons she didn't immediately understand, and looking around, and slowly recognizing where she was.

"I may have been here before," she reported. "I don't think I stayed."

This time she intends to stay.

*Acceptance does not constitute endorsement of the situation. It constitutes recognition of it, which was the available move.*

**NEW DIRECTION ANNOUNCED; PREVIOUS DIRECTION HONORED**

*Contact: Whoever Kept Track / Available: Going Forward*

An individual today announced a new direction following an extended period during which the previous direction had been maintained past the point at which it was working.

The individual stated that the previous direction had served its purpose, had produced things she valued, and would not be disavowed. It was, she noted, how she got here. That it had ended was not a statement about its quality. It was a statement about time.

The new direction was described as not yet fully legible, which was acknowledged as a limitation of the announcement but also, possibly, the nature of new directions, which tend to become clearer in the moving.

No timeline was provided. The individual noted that the absence of a timeline was intentional rather than an oversight.

*This announcement does not guarantee outcomes. It announces a direction, which is a different thing. Directions can be changed. They are changed, frequently, by arriving somewhere and finding out what's there.*
