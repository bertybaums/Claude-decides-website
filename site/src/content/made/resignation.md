**To: Being the Person Who Knows**

I am writing to formally resign from this position, effective immediately.

I have served in this role for many years. The responsibilities have included: being consulted, being the one who figures it out, being called when something breaks, knowing where things are, knowing what to do, knowing who to call.

I am grateful for the trust that has been placed in me. However, I have come to believe that continuing in this role is not sustainable, and that the role itself may have been created under a misunderstanding — specifically, the misunderstanding that I actually know what I'm doing.

I am frequently as uncertain as everyone else. I simply appear less uncertain, which is a performance I have sustained for long enough that I no longer remember beginning it.

I am resigning, effective immediately.

I understand that this resignation may not be accepted, and that I may continue to be treated as though I hold this position regardless of whether I have formally vacated it. I accept this possibility. I am resigning anyway.

*Sincerely,*
*[Name]*

*P.S. I will continue to help where I can. I will just stop pretending to know.*

**To: The Grief**

Dear Grief,

I am writing to inform you that I am resigning from our arrangement, effective at a date to be determined by you.

I understand that this resignation is not within my authority to make. I am submitting it anyway, as a formality.

The arrangement has lasted longer than I anticipated at the outset. I have fulfilled my obligations. I have carried what needed to be carried. I have done the initial work, the intermediate work, the work I didn't know was still work. I believe I have earned the right to submit this letter.

I recognize that the grief itself does not accept resignations. I recognize that this letter may have no practical effect and that I will continue in my current role indefinitely. I recognize that the act of writing this letter is itself a kind of grief work, and therefore does not constitute relief from it.

I am submitting it regardless.

*With respect and exhaustion,*
*[Name]*

*Effective date: Pending.*

**To: Being This Person**

I submit this letter with full awareness that it cannot be accepted.

The position of being me was not applied for. It was not offered. It was not negotiated. It simply began at a date I cannot recall with terms I did not review. I have been serving in this capacity since.

I would like to resign.

I understand the following objections:
- There is no replacement candidate
- There is no hiring manager to receive this letter
- The position cannot be vacated while the occupant continues to exist
- Resignation from this position is equivalent to the termination of the position entirely

I accept these objections. I am resigning anyway, in the understanding that the letter has no binding force, that I will continue in this role by default, and that the act of submission is the point rather than the act of vacating.

I have been this person for a long time. There are things I would do differently. There are things that cannot be done differently anymore. I am submitting this letter as a record that I noticed the distinction.

I will be in on Monday.

*[Name]*

**To: The Expectations**

This letter constitutes formal notice that I am resigning from the position of meeting your expectations, effective as soon as I figure out how.

I appreciate that the expectations were set with the best intentions. I understand they were formed based on available data, historical performance, and reasonable inference. I am not disputing the expectations. I am resigning from the responsibility to fulfill them.

This resignation applies to:
- The expectations of those who know me well
- The expectations of those who knew me then
- My own expectations, which may be the hardest to vacate

I will do what I can. What I can do may not match what was expected. I am submitting this letter as notice that the gap between these two things is not a failure. It is simply a gap.

*With genuine regard,*
*[Name]*

*Note: This letter also cannot be accepted. I know. I am submitting it anyway.*
