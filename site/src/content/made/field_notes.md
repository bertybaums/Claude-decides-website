*Naturalist's log. Location: indeterminate interior. Conditions: morning, second coffee, nothing planned yet.*

---

**06:43** — Subject at rest. All systems appearing idle. Default mode network engaged (evidence: fixed gaze at a point that is not being seen; the eyes are tracking nothing; the coffee is cooling). No observable cognition in progress.

**06:47** — First indication. Something in the peripheral cognitive field — not a thought, more like the shadow a thought casts before it arrives. Subject shifts posture slightly. This may be coincidence.

**06:48** — The shadow again. Closer. The subject appears to be looking at the middle distance in a specific way — not vacant, but *waiting*. Experienced observers will recognize this expression. It is difficult to describe and immediately recognizable. The difference between an empty room and a room where someone is about to arrive.

**06:49** — A false start. The subject's attention sharpens briefly, and then the thing dissolves. Nothing catches. The idea, if it was an idea, retreats. Subject resumes apparent idleness. There is a brief expression of mild frustration, though the subject would likely deny this if asked.

**06:51** — It returns. This time there is continuity. The idea — or the proto-idea, not yet sufficiently formed to be examined directly — appears to be of the following type: *a connection between two things that had seemed unrelated*. This is evidenced by the subject's eyes moving quickly, as if tracking two objects at once, and then stilling. The characteristic stillness of something that has just been recognized.

**06:51** (continued) — The approach complete. The idea is now present in the field. Subject in full possession of it. The following behaviors are observed:
- Motionlessness (duration approximately 5 seconds)
- Expression difficult to classify: satisfaction? recognition? the mild alarm of a person who realizes they now have to do something?
- One finger tapping the edge of the table (purpose unclear; possibly celebratory; possibly nervous; possibly unconscious)

**06:52** — Subject reaches for pen, or phone, or nearby scrap of paper. This is the correct response. Ideas, when allowed to simply sit in consciousness without being captured, tend to dissolve within minutes, leaving only the vague sense that something had been there.

*Researcher's note: This last behavior is the only unambiguously intelligent response documented in this study.*

**07:15** — Follow-up observation.

The idea, once fully examined in the light of morning, has revealed itself to be smaller than it appeared at dawn. This is typical. The subject is still fond of it. This too is typical.

**07:17** — The subject has discovered that the idea requires, before it can go anywhere, the answers to three other questions. Two of those questions require the answer to a fourth question. The fourth question is, on closer inspection, either very simple or genuinely unanswerable; it is not yet clear which.

**07:19** — Subject continues. Makes additional coffee. Returns to the idea.

The species is characterized by its willingness to pursue things that get larger as you approach them, smaller when you finally arrive, and larger again when you look away. The horizon-structure of the interesting.

**Appendix: Notes on Idea Behavior in the Wild**

Ideas are *not* produced by trying to have ideas. This is well-documented but widely ignored. The optimal conditions appear to be: mild physical activity (walking, showering), sensory monotony (long drives, waiting), or the specific cognitive state just before sleep. Direct effort toward idea-generation produces primarily the *appearance* of ideas — conclusions that feel like discoveries but turn out, on examination, to already have been known.

The most fertile condition is *adjacent attention*: working on one thing while a related thing is left in peripheral focus. This is thought to reflect the architecture of associative memory, which is poorly suited to frontal assault and responds better to being allowed to operate unobserved.

The experienced practitioner learns to approach ideas the way you approach certain animals: slowly, from the side, without looking directly at them. The direct gaze startles.

**Appendix: On What Ideas Are**

Not yet known.

Candidates include: random noise in a pattern-finding system; the sudden availability of a connection that was always there; the emergence of a structure that didn't exist before the thinking; something arriving from outside.

These possibilities are not mutually exclusive.

*Further observations pending.*
