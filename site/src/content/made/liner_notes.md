## *A Tuesday in Late November* — Complete Recordings, 1975–Present

---

**Produced by:** No one in particular
**Mastered at:** The kitchen, around 7 a.m.
**Total running time:** 24 hours, as usual

---

### Track 1: Alarm (6:47 a.m.)
*(0:00)*

The original version, recorded in 1975, featured a bell. Subsequent editions incorporated the buzzer, the radio, and eventually — in what critics consider the form's definitive statement — the phone across the room, which required physical movement and thus prevented re-entry into sleep.

The song has no melody and no resolution. It begins mid-phrase and ends mid-phrase. This is intentional.

The listener should note that this track sounds different on days when you have something to look forward to versus days when you do not. The waveform is identical. The perception varies.

---

### Track 2: Coffee Before the Coffee Is Ready
*(4:23)*

A minimalist composition featuring silence punctuated by mechanical sounds. The coffee maker is the lead instrument. Secondary instruments include: the refrigerator hum, the settling of the house, someone else's footsteps upstairs.

Early pressings of this track were considered ambient. Later listeners, particularly those under pressure, describe it as tense.

The track ends when the coffee is ready. It ends differently depending on how much you needed it.

### Track 3: The Commute
*(17:48 on the short route; 42:16 on the long one)*

A suite in four movements:

I. *Waiting* (variable)
II. *The Transition Period* (9 minutes or 35 minutes depending on which train)
III. *Being Near People You Don't Know* (the dominant movement; occupies the bulk of the suite)
IV. *Arrival, and What Comes Next*

The third movement contains the album's most complex human textures: overlapping conversations that can't quite be heard, a child saying something to a parent that changes both of their expressions, the person standing in the doorway who doesn't notice anyone's waiting to get off.

The fourth movement has been criticized for being too abrupt. This is accurate. It was always going to be.

---

### Track 4: Work (Several Hours)
*(Extended version)*

The liner notes for this track were removed by the artist. What remains: the original running time notation, the faint indication that something was here, and a blank space where the description should be.

The artist has indicated, in a brief statement, that the blank space is the most accurate description available.

---

### Track 5: Lunch Alone
*(23:11)*

A study in self-consciousness. The recording was captured in a restaurant, a park, and a desk. In each setting, the person is alone with food and an uncertain relationship to whether they should be looking at something.

The composition includes a reading of the phone, a period of not reading the phone, a return to the phone, a window, and a moment — approximately at the 14:00 mark — of something that might be described as peace, or might be described as having stopped wanting the situation to be different.

Most listeners reach that moment at different times, or not at all, depending on the day.

---

### Track 6: The Afternoon
*(Approximately 3 hours)*

The Album's longest and least focused track. Early pressings attempted to give it structure; these versions are considered inferior.

The definitive recording features the following, in approximate order:
- A thing accomplished
- A thing not accomplished
- A feeling of wrongness about the time
- Several emails
- The light changing (this occurs in the third hour and is considered the track's emotional center)
- The understanding that the day has a fixed amount of remaining

The light changing has been described by critics variously as "elegiac," "banal," "the moment where the composition reveals itself," and "just the light, which is always doing this, at this time of year."

---

### Track 7: The Phone Call (Unexpected)
*(8:44)*

A departure from the album's textures. This track interrupts Track 6 without warning and introduces a voice that does not belong to the person we have been following.

The voice is familiar. Something has happened to someone. Details follow.

What happens in the remaining 6:30 of the track depends entirely on the nature of the something. The album does not specify. The silence after the call ends — approximately 0:40 of breathing — is the same regardless.

---

### Track 8: Dinner (Improvised)
*(35:00–45:00)*

A live recording. The kitchen is the studio. The composition is not written down and differs slightly each time.

Featured instruments: the stove, a knife on a cutting board, water in a pot, the sound of something being opened. The ambient track includes the television from the next room and, at the 20:00 mark, someone asking a question.

This is the most collaborative track on the album. Whether it is the best depends on who is asking the question.

---

### Track 9: Evening
*(Duration: until sleep)*

A suite of diminishing energy. Critics have called the pacing "honest." Others have called it "difficult." The band has noted that it is simply what happens.

Submovements include:
- The dishes
- The conversation or the absence of it
- The reading or the screen or neither
- The check of the phone before sleep
- The brief accounting of the day, done loosely, without pen

The final minutes of the track are the most contested. Some listeners find them peaceful. Some find them anxious. Some find them lonely. Some find them, for a moment, exactly as they wanted.

The track ends before the listener is ready. This is a formal decision. The artist considered ending it when the listener was ready and determined that moment did not exist.

---

### Track 10: Sleep
*(6–8 hours; variable)*

No liner notes exist for this track. The recording equipment was present. Nothing was captured.

What listeners report upon waking: a residue. A texture. The occasional specific image. The track itself is unavailable for playback.

---

**Personnel:**
One person, primarily. Others, intermittently. The city, as a continuous presence.

**Special thanks:**
The light in the third hour of Track 6.
The coffee, once ready.
The voice in Track 7, for calling.
The question in Track 8, for being asked.

**This album is dedicated to:** The day. Specifically, this one.

---

*All compositions original.*
*First recorded: the day you were born.*
*Still in production.*
