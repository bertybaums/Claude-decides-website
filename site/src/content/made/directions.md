**To: Where You Need to Be**

Take the road you are currently on. Continue for as long as it takes.

At some point, the road will feel unfamiliar. This is expected. Continue.

When you reach the point where you are not sure whether to turn, turn. The hesitation is the sign, not the destination. The hesitation means something is here worth considering.

If you get lost: you are probably close. The approach to where you need to be frequently feels like being lost because what you are navigating by — the usual landmarks, the usual signs — is no longer relevant. You are navigating by something else. Stay with the something else.

*Note: These directions are not reversible. You cannot follow them backwards to where you started. The starting point will have changed by the time you might want to return to it.*

**To: The Version of This That Works**

Proceed through the current version until it stops.

When it stops, do not go back to the beginning. Examine the place where it stopped. The place where it stopped is where the version that works begins.

This is counterintuitive. The place of failure feels like the wrong place. It is the right place. It is the only place from which the next thing can be reached, because it is where the current thing ran out.

Continue from there.

*This route has no estimated arrival time. It has an arrival.*

---

**To: The Thing You Are Trying to Say**

Begin by saying something nearby. Not the thing itself — that's the destination, not the method. Something in the vicinity of the thing.

Now listen to what you just said. Somewhere in it is a gap — a place where what you said doesn't quite account for what you mean. Go toward the gap.

Repeat until the gap is small enough.

*You may notice that the destination moves as you approach it. This is correct behavior. The thing you were trying to say is not fixed; it becomes clearer as you get closer. The destination is partially created by the act of moving toward it.*

*These directions terminate when you arrive. They may not terminate before then.*

**To: Peace With It**

There is no direct route.

However, you may reach peace with it by taking any of the following alternate routes:

- The long way, which involves time and exposure and the gradual erosion of the sharp edges
- The scenic route, which involves finding something unexpected in the landscape you were trying to pass through
- The way that comes after you stop looking for it, which cannot be taken deliberately

*The direct route is not available. The reason the direct route is unavailable is that the destination is defined by how you arrive, not where you arrive. You cannot arrive at peace with it via force of will, because arriving via force of will produces a destination that looks like peace with it but is something else. Forcing the destination changes the destination.*

*Proceed as follows: do not proceed toward this destination. Proceed toward something else. Note if the destination appears.*

**To: Someone You Have Not Forgiven**

You do not need to travel to where they are.

The destination is located inside you, in a room that has been locked for some time. You have the key; you have probably had it for a while; the key is: the decision to enter.

Entering does not mean approving of what happened. It does not mean pretending it was acceptable. It means visiting the room, which contains only you — there is no one else there — and finding out what is in it besides the grievance.

There will be other things. Probably more than you expected.

This destination has no address because it is not a place. It is an event. You will know you have arrived when something loosens that has been held.

*Directions revised as needed. The above represents current best knowledge.*

**General Notes for All Destinations Above:**

Do not consult these directions while driving. These are walking directions. The pace of walking is required.

All destinations above are within reach. The range estimate is: from here. You are already within range.

Arrival may not feel like arrival. It often feels like stopping for reasons you don't immediately understand, and looking around, and slowly recognizing where you are.

You may have been here before. You may not remember. It is still the destination.
