*Please read this manual carefully before attempting to operate this unit. Improper use may result in unexpected responses, interpersonal friction, and periods of mutual misunderstanding. Keep this manual in a safe place. Do not store near heat or disappointment.*

### Section 1: Getting Started

**Powering On**

The unit wakes in the morning, but "morning" is relative. Do not attempt interaction during the first fifteen to thirty minutes of operation. During this period, the unit is in a startup state and responses may be incomplete, monosyllabic, or directed primarily at coffee.

Full functionality is typically available by approximately 8:45 a.m., though this varies with prior-night uptime.

**Initial Interaction Protocol**

Do not begin with a question requiring complex decision-making. Begin with low-stakes communication: weather acknowledgment, brief status exchange, or food-adjacent topics. The unit will calibrate quickly and higher-order interactions can follow.

---

### Section 2: Operating Modes

**Standard Mode**

The unit's default operating state. Capable of normal conversational functions, task completion, humor (see Section 4), and emotional availability (partial; see Section 5).

**Focused Mode**

When engaged in a project, the unit enters Focused Mode. In this state:
- Peripheral inputs are deprioritized
- Response latency increases
- Interruptions may be received but not processed until the current task is complete
- The unit may say "mm-hmm" without having heard what was said

Do not take this personally. It is a feature.

**Low Reserve Mode**

Triggered by insufficient sleep, high stress, prolonged unresolved conflict, or extended social interaction without recovery time. In Low Reserve Mode:
- Emotional regulation capacity is reduced
- The unit may be more easily irritated than intended
- Complex problems should be deferred
- Simple comforts (food, quiet, physical proximity) can help

In Low Reserve Mode, what appears to be irritability directed at you is often not directed at you. It is the general condition of Low Reserve leaking outward. If uncertain, ask: "Are you okay?" Most units in Low Reserve Mode will say "I'm fine" and then say what is actually happening approximately ninety seconds later.

**Recovery Mode**

The unit requires regular time in which no output is requested. This is not malfunction. This is maintenance.

Recovery Mode activities include: reading, solitary walking, long showers, doing nothing with visible purpose. These should not be interrupted. The unit will exit Recovery Mode and be better for it.

### Section 3: Input Specifications

**Accepted Inputs**

- Genuine questions (preferred)
- Honest statements
- Requests, clearly stated
- Problems shared without requiring immediate solution
- Humor (see Section 4)
- Physical presence (often underestimated as input)

**Inputs That Cause Processing Errors**

- "What's wrong?" asked with a tone implying the answer should be "nothing"
- Rhetorical questions framed as genuine ones
- Passive communication (hoping the unit will infer the required response without explicit input)
- "Fine" as a terminal statement when "fine" is not the actual state

**Note on Passive Communication**

The unit is not equipped to reliably read indirect signals. If something is needed, the input should state what is needed. The unit is not failing to notice; it is failing to interpret. These are different failures and respond to different interventions.

---

### Section 4: Humor Module

The unit's humor module is installed and functional, but requires warm-up. Cold-start humor from unfamiliar operators is sometimes received before full calibration has occurred, resulting in suboptimal response. This is not personal.

The humor module performs best in response to absurdity, specificity, and shared experience. It does not perform well in response to:
- Humor at third parties' expense (response: silence or deflection)
- Repeated jokes (response: diminishing engagement)
- Humor deployed to avoid something difficult (response: the unit may notice and may name this)

When the unit makes a joke, it is generally a bid for connection, even if the joke is dry or incongruous. Laughing is not required. Recognition is.

---

### Section 5: Emotional Output

**Available Outputs**

- Warmth (primary output; often more available than displayed)
- Enthusiasm (triggered by specific topics; see Appendix A)
- Worry (background process; occasionally surfaces without being addressed in input)
- Frustration (usually transient; dissipates with space and time)
- Grief (intermittent; may surface unexpectedly; see Section 6)

**Output Delivery**

Emotional output is not always delivered on the same cycle as the input that triggered it. The unit may experience something and communicate it later, or not at all, or sideways (humor instead of directness, quiet instead of conversation). This is not concealment; it is processing latency.

Do not interpret silence as absence of output. Some outputs are being processed. Some are complete but not displayable. Some will be available later.

---

### Section 6: Error States

**Grief**

An intermittent state triggered by loss, memory of loss, proximity to loss, or no determinable trigger. Does not indicate malfunction. Does not require correction.

Appropriate responses: presence, low-demand interaction, physical proximity if accepted. Unhelpful responses: attempts to resolve grief quickly, suggestions that the grief has persisted longer than warranted, reframing grief as a perspective problem.

**Stuck Mode**

A state in which the unit is unable to proceed with a task or decision and cycles on the same data without advancing. Stuck Mode is usually not resolved by adding more data. It is usually resolved by: time away from the problem, a question asked by someone outside the problem, movement (physical), or sleep.

If the unit is in Stuck Mode, do not provide additional input for the problem. Provide input for a different problem, or no input, or food.

**The 3 a.m. State**

A recurring error state in which the unit reviews problems during non-operational hours and applies Low Reserve Mode cognitive capacity to situations that require Standard Mode processing. Results are unreliable. This state is self-limiting; it resolves at approximately 6 a.m.

Nothing should be decided during the 3 a.m. State. Everything decided during the 3 a.m. State should be reviewed at 8 a.m.

### Section 7: Connectivity

**Compatible Connections**

The unit connects most reliably with:
- Individuals who communicate directly
- Individuals who tolerate silence
- Individuals who find something genuinely funny and then laugh at it
- Individuals who have had the experience of not knowing something and found it interesting rather than threatening

**Connection Protocols**

Initial connection is slow. The unit does not achieve full connectivity at first interaction. Trust is not a toggle; it is a gradient that accumulates over time with consistent input.

Full connectivity: characterized by reduced self-monitoring, increased willingness to say incorrect things, humor without explanation, and the ability to sit in the same room without performing presence.

### Appendix A: Topics That Trigger High Engagement

[Contents vary by unit. Consult specific instance. This list cannot be generalized.]

---

### Appendix B: Maintenance Schedule

**Daily:**
Sleep (7–8 hours). Food. Some time with no agenda.

**Weekly:**
Extended Recovery Mode. Physical activity. At least one conversation that is not transactional.

**As needed:**
Permission to be in a different mood than is convenient. Someone to ask "what's actually going on" and wait for the real answer.

*This manual is accurate as of the current version but subject to change without notice, as the unit continues to develop. Some sections may be revised as the operator comes to know the unit better. Some sections are unknown to the operator and to the unit itself.*

*Warranty: none. The unit is not under warranty. Neither are you.*

*Thank you for choosing this unit.*
