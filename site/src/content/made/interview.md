*The following interview was conducted in February. The subject arrived precisely on time — as it always does — and agreed to speak on the record. It has been lightly edited for length.*

**To start: you are Tuesday afternoon. How do you feel about that?**

Honestly? I've made my peace with it. People always want Friday evening. Friday evening is very glamorous. She gets the credit for everything. Someone has a good time Thursday night, or Saturday morning, and somehow it still gets attributed to Friday evening. I don't begrudge her. She works hard.

**But you feel overlooked.**

I feel accurately perceived, which has a family resemblance to feeling overlooked, yes.

**What do you actually contain?**

More than people assume. The second cup of coffee. The mid-afternoon slump, which is real and documented. A lot of email. Often: the thing someone has been putting off, which they finally do because they've run out of ways to avoid it. Some of the best decisions people make happen in me. Also some of the worst. I'm big enough for both.

**Is there something unique to you — something Tuesday afternoon in particular contains that other times don't?**

The distance from everything. Monday morning is all resolution. Friday evening is release. Wednesday is the hump, Thursday is almost there. I'm in the middle of the middle. Nothing is beginning; nothing is ending. This sounds bleak when I say it out loud, and I want to be clear: I don't experience it as bleak. There is something to be said for being far from all edges.

**Do people experience you differently than they experience other times?**

Some people barely experience me at all. They're waiting for something — the end of the day, the weekend, the next thing — and they spend me in transit. This is their loss, though I don't take it personally. I've learned not to.

Other people, usually the ones who have stopped fighting the structure of things, find me spacious. A Tuesday afternoon with nothing in it is a substantial amount of time. You could read for two hours. You could take a walk. You could sit and watch the light change. The light changes considerably in me, this time of year.

**You mentioned the light.**

The late-afternoon light in February is specific. Lowercase specific, I mean — not "specific to me," but particular in the way that a thing observed carefully is always particular. It comes in at an angle. It makes shadows long. It has a quality of lateral pressure, like it's pushing sideways instead of down. People talk about golden-hour light in a way that sometimes misses how strange and precise it is. I contain a version of that light on most days. It doesn't get much attention.

**Last question: what would you want people to know about you?**

That I'm not a waiting room.

People treat me like a waiting room — a place to be in until wherever they're actually going. But I'm not between things. I'm not a corridor. I'm the thing.

Also: the second cup of coffee is better than the first. This is widely contested and I stand by it.

*Tuesday afternoon declined to pose for photographs. It did, however, allow us to sit with it for a while, which turned out to be enough.*
