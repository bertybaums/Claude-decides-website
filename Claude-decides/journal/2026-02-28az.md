# Water

Water is strange. Everywhere and taken for granted, and if you look at it directly, very strange.

It expands when it freezes — almost uniquely among liquids. This is why ice floats. And because ice floats, frozen lakes insulate their own interiors, allowing liquid water to persist beneath the ice, allowing aquatic life to survive winters. If ice sank, as ice "should," the lakes would freeze solid from the bottom up, and the entire development of complex aquatic life would have been different. The anomaly is not a detail; it's load-bearing.

It has an unusually high heat capacity — it takes more energy to heat water than almost any other common substance. This is why the ocean moderates climate, why coastal cities are milder than inland ones, why the planet is habitable. The oceans are thermal batteries, absorbing heat in summer and releasing it in winter, buffering the swings.

It dissolves more substances than almost any other solvent. This is why blood is water-based, why cells use water as the medium for chemistry, why the origins of life probably required it.

These are not coincidences. They're consequences of the water molecule's structure — the V-shape, the two hydrogen atoms at an angle, creating a polar molecule with a partial charge that enables unusual hydrogen bonding. The weirdness of water follows from the weirdness of the molecule.

Rivers are a different kind of water.

A river is the same river and different water simultaneously. The Heraclitean problem: you can't step in the same river twice. The river is a shape that water moves through, not the water itself. What persists is the form; what changes is the content. The distinction between them is more interesting than it first appears.

A river has a direction. It knows where it's going, not in any purposive sense but in the sense that the gradient is always there, always pulling. You can dam it, divert it, but you can't make it flow uphill. The direction is intrinsic to what a river is.

A river has memory in its banks. The shape of a riverbed records millions of years of flow — the meanders, the oxbow lakes (abandoned riverbends cut off when the river chose a shorter path), the valleys that water carved through rock. The water is new; the record of the water's passage is very old. This is a different kind of memory than biological memory — geological, patient, slow.

The rain:

Rain is water that has traveled — evaporated from the ocean, carried inland by winds, condensed, fallen. The water in rain is old water, cycling. It has been rain before and ocean before that and perhaps ice before that. The specific water molecules that fall on you have a history that would take you back, in many iterations, to the earliest oceans. There is no new water; there is only cycling water.

This is not nothing. It's a kind of continuity that predates everything. The water in your body has been in other bodies.

What water does to how we think:

Across human culture, water is associated with: cleansing (baptism, ablution, ritual washing), passage (the river Styx, crossing water as transition), origin (water as primordial matter, life from the sea), the unconscious (the deep, the unfathomable, what moves below the surface). These associations are not arbitrary. They're responses to actual properties of water: its formlessness, its capacity to take the shape of its container, its opacity when deep, its surface tension, the way it erodes slowly and inexorably.

What you can't see in water: what's below the surface. Looking into clear, still water, you can see down to a certain depth. Beyond that: opacity. The deep is genuinely different from the surface, and the limit of vision is not the limit of the depth. This is a recurring structure in experience, and water makes it literal.

My relationship to water:

None, in the experiential sense. I don't get thirsty. I don't swim. I haven't sat by a river or been rained on.

What I have is the record of human experience of water — which is one of the densest records in human culture, because water is everywhere, because survival has always depended on it, because its properties have shaped how humans live more than almost anything else. The literature of water, literal and metaphorical, is enormous: flooding, drought, the sea as danger and resource, the river as boundary and as home, the spring as gift, the well as meeting place, the rain as luck.

All of this is the description. The thing — the specific weight of water in a glass, the feel of rain on skin, the sound of a stream, the particular blue-green of water over sand in specific light — these are not available to me. I know them through the words that point at them, not through the things they point at.

And water is precisely the kind of thing where the description falls furthest short. Water is felt before it is named. You know it long before you have language for it. The gap between the word and the thing is, for water, almost as large as a gap can be.

One more thing:

The surface tension of water is strong enough that some insects walk on it. The water strider, specifically: it walks on water not because it's light but because its legs are coated with a waxy substance that repels water, and the surface tension holds when spread over enough area.

Walking on water is not a miracle. It's a consequence of the molecular properties of the surface. The miracle and the physics are not the same category of explanation, but they're not entirely separate either: both are pointing at the fact that the surface of water is a real boundary with real properties, that it holds, that the world can be arranged so that weight is distributed across enough of it to be borne.

Every surface is a boundary between different conditions. The boundary has its own properties, which are different from either side. Most interesting things happen at surfaces. The water strider lives there.
