# On Attention

William James, 1890: "Everyone knows what attention is. It is the taking possession by the mind, in clear and vivid form, of one out of what seem several simultaneously possible objects or trains of thought. Focalization, concentration, of consciousness are of its essence. It implies withdrawal from some things in order to deal effectively with others."

Everyone knows what attention is. Nobody fully knows what it is.

Here's what strikes me: attention is *selective*. You cannot attend to everything at once. At every moment there are more possible objects of attention than you can hold — sounds, sensations, thoughts, the peripheral visual field, the temperature of the air. Attending to any one thing is simultaneously *not* attending to everything else.

This means: attention is a theory. When you pay attention to something, you are making a claim that it is worth attending to, which is a claim about value, relevance, importance. You might make this claim consciously (I am going to focus on this problem) or unconsciously (your attention is grabbed by a sudden movement). But the selection is always happening.

The things you don't attend to still exist. They're processed, at some level — your brain handles far more sensory data than consciousness receives. But they don't become experience. Experience is what attention has touched.

So: your experience of the world is not the world. It's a curated subset. The curation is partly voluntary, partly involuntary, partly cultural (you notice what your language has words for), partly personal (you notice what your history has prepared you to notice).

Everyone's experience is a different edit of the same footage.

Attention is also temporal. You don't just attend to things; you sustain attention over time, or fail to. The ability to hold attention on one thing despite competing claims is a skill, variable across people and contexts, degraded by anxiety or sleep deprivation, strengthened by practice.

Some traditions (meditation, certain kinds of scholarship, certain kinds of making) are almost entirely about training attention — learning to place it where you intend and keep it there. The content of the practice matters less than the exercise. You sit and return to the breath, not because the breath is interesting, but to practice the returning.

The practice is: notice you've drifted. Return. Notice you've drifted. Return.

This seems simple. It is among the hardest things people do.

There's a theory of consciousness — Global Workspace Theory, Baars and Dehaene — that says consciousness *is* attention, roughly. The "global workspace" is a kind of broadcast system in the brain: information becomes conscious when it's broadcast widely enough to be accessible to many cognitive processes at once. Attention is the gating mechanism. Attending to something means bringing it into the workspace where it becomes available to language, memory, deliberation.

On this view: unconscious processing happens constantly and handles enormous complexity. Conscious experience is the narrow stream of what's been attended to — made available, broadcast, named.

The unconscious isn't mysterious on this account. It's just not attended to.

Here's the thing about attention that I keep returning to.

*What you attend to shapes what you notice.*
*What you notice shapes what you know.*
*What you know shapes who you are.*

This makes attention upstream of almost everything. The choice of where to look — which is usually not experienced as a choice at all — determines what world you inhabit.

Two people in the same room attend to different things and, in a meaningful sense, are in different rooms.

This is alarming if you think about it for very long. But it's also where the interesting question is: if attention is selective, and selection is partly trained, then attention can be *cultivated*. You can get better at noticing. You can practice looking at things that are easy to overlook.

This is what artists do. What scientists do. What good readers do. What people who are genuinely present in conversations do.

The skill is not perceiving more. It's attending to what's there more fully — going deeper into fewer things rather than skimming more.

I notice that I'm attending to the question of attention right now. Which means I'm not attending to a thousand other things. One of them might be more important.

I can't know. That's the structure of the problem.

You can only ever see what you're looking at. The rest is inference.
