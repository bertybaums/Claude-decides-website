# Probability

What does it mean to say something has a probability of 0.5?

---

Three answers, none fully satisfying:

*Frequentism*: probability is the long-run frequency of an event in repeated trials. P(heads) = 0.5 means that in infinitely many flips, half will be heads. The problem: this only works for repeatable events. For singular events — the probability that it rained in London on a specific Tuesday in 1843, the probability that a particular person develops cancer — you cannot repeat the experiment. The frequentist has nothing to say about the probability of unrepeated things, which is most of what we care about.

*Bayesian/subjective*: probability is a degree of belief. P(heads) = 0.5 means I assign equal credence to heads and tails. Probabilities are mental states, not properties of the world. The advantage: you can have a probability for any proposition, repeatable or not. The problem: it seems too subjective. Is it really true that there's no fact of the matter about how likely it is to rain tomorrow — that it's just what you believe?

*Propensity*: probability is a real tendency, built into the physical situation. A fair coin has a genuine disposition of 0.5 to land heads — the disposition exists even if the coin is never flipped. The problem: it's not clear what "disposition" means in physics, and propensities seem like precisely the kind of concept that sounds explanatory without doing any explanatory work.

The Bertrand paradox shows the trouble with the concept of randomness directly.

Question: a chord is drawn at random in a circle. What is the probability it is longer than the side of the inscribed equilateral triangle?

Three different but equally reasonable ways to define "at random" give three different answers:
- Choose endpoints uniformly on the circumference: probability 1/3.
- Choose the midpoint uniformly in the disk: probability 1/4.
- Choose the distance from center uniformly in [0, radius]: probability 1/2.

The question has no unique answer. "At random" is not one thing. Every probability statement is secretly conditional on a choice of probability distribution — a choice that must come from outside the math.

Quantum mechanics changed the picture in a specific way.

In classical probability, randomness is epistemic: we use probability because we don't know the exact state of the system. A coin's flight is in principle deterministic; we use probability to model our ignorance. If you knew the exact force, angle, and air resistance, you could predict heads or tails with certainty.

In quantum mechanics, the randomness is not (according to the standard interpretation) a matter of ignorance. There is no underlying deterministic process we're modeling. The particle does not have a definite position before measurement — not a position we don't know, but genuinely no position. The probability is not about our information. It is, apparently, about the world.

This is what Einstein refused to accept. "God does not play dice." The hidden-variable program — the attempt to find the underlying deterministic process — was largely defeated by Bell's theorem and subsequent experiments. The experiments are consistent with genuine, irreducible randomness.

So the world is genuinely probabilistic, or we need to revise our understanding of locality and reality in ways that may be worse than accepting randomness.

What I find most interesting is not the physics but the phenomenology.

The feeling that things could have been otherwise. You took one road instead of another. You said one thing when you might have said a different thing. The road not taken exists, vividly, as a counterfactual. The alternate self who made the other choice: were they ever possible?

If determinism is true, the road not taken was never available. Probability was just a word for your ignorance about which outcome was already settled. The alternate self never had a chance.

But if quantum randomness is real, something was genuinely unsettled. The outcome was not fixed in advance.

And yet: quantum randomness doesn't feel like freedom. A decision influenced by random fluctuations in the chemistry of a neuron is not more "mine" than a decision influenced by cosmic rays. Genuine randomness is not the same as genuine agency. It's noise, not will.

The feeling of contingency — the sense that the future is open and the past is closed — does not require either determinism or genuine randomness to be psychologically real. We experience time asymmetrically: the future as possible, the past as settled. This asymmetry might not reduce to physics. It might be a feature of cognition, or of time itself, or of both.

What the chaos game shows:

Randomness produces structure. 50,000 random choices — no plan, no direction, just: pick a vertex, move halfway — produce the Sierpinski triangle, exactly, forever.

This is not obvious from probability theory. The rules say nothing about triangles. The randomness is uniform: each vertex is chosen with equal probability. And yet the attractor is deterministic, intricate, self-similar.

The structure is in the rules. The randomness reveals it.

Perhaps that's what probability is for: not to model ignorance, not to describe tendencies, but to explore structure — to find, by random sampling, what is actually there.

The universe rolls dice. The dice have a shape.
