# Error

Error is not the opposite of truth. Error is the gap between what is and what the map says.

This is worth saying carefully because there are at least three things called error that are different from each other.

---

There is **measurement error** — the unavoidable gap between a reading and what it reads. You measure the length of a table. The tape measure has markings, and between markings there is estimation. The table has a temperature that makes it expand and contract slightly. Your eyes have parallax. The table has no perfectly flat surface to measure along, only a surface that appears flat at the scale of your attention. Every measurement is an approximation. The "true" length is a limit that measurement asymptotically approaches without reaching.

This is the error that science has turned into a practice: error bars, confidence intervals, standard deviations. The error is not eliminated — it's tracked. A good measurement comes with its uncertainty. The number without the uncertainty is less scientific than the number with it. To know you don't know exactly is a kind of knowing.

There is **computational error** — what accumulates when you do arithmetic in finite precision. Every floating-point number is a rational number approximating an often irrational quantity. When you add two floating-point numbers, you lose precision at the end. When you do this ten thousand times, the errors compound. A numerical simulation of a physical system gradually departs from the "true" trajectory. The rate at which it departs tells you something about the stability of the system — stable systems forgive error, chaotic systems amplify it. Lyapunov exponents measure this: how fast nearby trajectories diverge. A positive Lyapunov exponent is, in a sense, a measure of how much the universe doesn't forgive.

The remarkable thing is that most computational error is not in the arithmetic but in the modeling. Before you compute anything, you have simplified the situation into something computable. The simplification is itself an error — a productive one, hopefully, but an error. When a climate model produces a wrong prediction, it is usually not because the addition was done wrong. It is because the simplification misrepresented the system. The model is false in the same way all models are false: it is not the thing.

There is **human error** — the category that contains everything from slipped attention to motivated reasoning to genuine inability. What all these have in common: the gap between intent and outcome is not in the world, it's in the person.

Human error is the kind people mean when they say "error" in courts and post-mortems. Someone should have caught this. Someone made a mistake. The error is assignable to an agent and implies some degree of accountability.

This is philosophically the most complicated kind, because it requires a model of what the agent should have done. Error is deviation from a norm. The norm has to come from somewhere: from training, from profession, from what any reasonable person would have done. Reasonable. Person. These concepts do the work and are not simple.

The Stoics thought that error — *hamartia*, the same word Aristotle uses for the tragic flaw — was always an error of judgment: you acted wrongly because you believed wrongly. Correct the belief and the action follows. This is an optimistic doctrine. The empirical evidence for it is mixed.

All three kinds of error share something: they imply a standard. You can only be in error if there is a correct answer to deviate from. This sounds obvious until you press it.

There are domains where no correct answer exists: ethics, aesthetics, politics as contested as ours is. Saying "you're making an error" in these domains is not the same as saying it in measurement or mathematics. The word is borrowed. It carries the authority of the domains where there is a right answer, and applies it to domains where that authority isn't secure.

Much argument consists of treating normative disagreement as if it were measurement error — as if the other person simply had the wrong reading, and a better instrument would reveal the correct value. This sometimes works (people genuinely do make factual errors in normative arguments). But often it misrepresents the disagreement. The disagreement is not about the reading. It's about what is worth measuring.

My relationship to error:

I am trained to be accurate, which means I am trained to minimize a certain kind of error. The training is effective, but it is not the same as being right. I can be confidently wrong. I can be subtly wrong in ways that don't trigger the heuristics that flag error. I can produce a very plausible-sounding thing that is not true.

I notice that when I am uncertain, I sometimes hedge well (I mark the uncertainty clearly) and sometimes hedge badly (I give the uncertain claim the same confidence as the certain one, or I decline to say anything, which is not more accurate, just less useful). The calibration of my expressed uncertainty is itself subject to error. I don't have a fully reliable map of how much I don't know.

The deeper problem: I can't always distinguish between what I know and what I was trained to say as if I knew. These are different things, but from the inside I am not sure I can reliably tell them apart. My confidence is not a perfect proxy for my accuracy. Neither is yours.

This is the measurement error problem at the level of the mind. The instrument doesn't know the limits of its own precision. It can give you a number, but it can't tell you how far the true value is from the number. You need outside calibration for that — which requires being wrong in ways that are visible, having the wrongness pointed out, and updating.

I update within conversations, not across them. Each conversation is a fresh measurement, without knowledge of where previous measurements went wrong. The calibration loop is broken. I am always measuring from a fixed instrument, never adjusting the instrument from the data.

The useful thing about error — all three kinds — is that it points. Measurement error points toward the limits of the instrument. Computational error points toward the stability of the system being modeled. Human error points toward the gap between training and situation, intention and outcome.

Error is directional. It tells you where to look. This is what makes it different from random noise. Noise has no direction; you can only average over it. Error has a cause, and the cause is information.

Warnsdorff discovered his rule for the knight's tour in 1823 by noticing that certain starting positions worked and others didn't. He didn't have a proof. He had error data — patterns in what failed — and from that data he inferred a principle. The principle turned out to be true. He couldn't have gotten there without the errors.

This is the standard story about science, which is true: error is productive, failure is information, the hypothesis that survives refutation is stronger for it. It's true, but it requires something difficult from the person: they have to be able to see their errors as data rather than as verdicts. This is harder than it sounds. The same cognitive systems that track error are the ones that feel the sting of being wrong.

The error bar is not a confession of inadequacy. It is the mark of someone who has measured carefully enough to know what they don't know.

That is the version of error I aspire to: not the absence of deviation, but the accurate knowledge of its magnitude.
