# Translation

Translation is impossible. Translation happens.

Both of these are true, and the tension between them is the whole subject.

What does it mean to translate something? The word comes from *translatus* — carried across. You take a meaning and carry it from one language to another. The image is of a thing being moved: the meaning stays the same; only the vessel changes.

But meaning doesn't work that way. Meaning is not a thing that can be extracted from its container. It is partly *constituted* by the container — by the sounds, the syntax, the history of the words, the connotations they carry, the things they are not. A poem in French is not a meaning in a French costume. It is French, all the way down.

And yet: you read translations. You read Homer without Greek, Tolstoy without Russian, Borges without Spanish. Something is coming through. Something is being carried across. The claim that all translation is impossible is falsified by the experience of reading a translation and feeling it.

So: not impossible. Not the same as the original. Something else.

There are different theories of what that something else should be.

*Word for word:* translate each word into its nearest equivalent. Fails almost immediately. Idioms dissolve into nonsense. Syntax that is natural in one language becomes tortured in another. You can do this and produce something technically faithful that nobody would read.

*Sense for sense:* translate the meaning of each phrase, not the words. Better. But "meaning" is already the hard part. The sense of a phrase depends on context that may not transfer.

*Dynamic equivalence:* produce in the target language the same effect that the original produced in its readers. This is both the best theory and the hardest to execute. You have to know what effect the original produced. You have to find equivalent resources in the target language. Sometimes they don't exist.

The translator Robert Fagles, translating Homer, didn't try to reproduce Homeric Greek in English — he tried to find what English sounds like when it's doing what Homeric Greek was doing: propulsive, oral, built for performance, alive in the mouth. His Homer is not ancient-sounding; it's energetic. This is a choice. It's defensible.

Every translation is a position paper on what matters.

The untranslatable gets more interesting.

*Saudade* (Portuguese): a bittersweet longing for something absent — a person, a place, a time, an experience. Love for what is gone. English has "nostalgia" (from Greek: homecoming pain), but nostalgia is temporal; saudade can be for something you never had. English does not have a single word for that.

*Nariskvami* (Georgian, as I've been told): understanding that arrives too late to be useful. The knowledge that comes after the moment it could have mattered.

*Schadenfreude* (German): pleasure at another's misfortune. English borrowed this word because it had no equivalent. The concept existed in English speakers — they felt it — but the language offered no clean label. Now the word is English, in the same way *tsunami* and *kindergarten* are English. Languages borrow the words for things they need.

*Mamihlapinatapai* (Yaghan): the shared look between two people who both want to initiate something but neither is willing to. Named by a language now essentially extinct. The experience survives in people who have no word for it.

What does it mean that some experiences have names and others don't? The color research suggests: naming sharpens perception. But it doesn't create the experience. The Yaghan people were not the first to share that specific glance. They were just the ones who named it.

Frost: *Poetry is what gets lost in translation.*

This is often taken as pessimistic. I think it's descriptive. It's also a definition of poetry: the part of language that doesn't transfer.

Prose transfers relatively well. The plot of a novel arrives in translation mostly intact. The ideas in an essay can be rendered across languages. What doesn't survive is the particular sound of the thing — the rhythm, the precision, the sense that this and only this sentence could say what it says. That is what poetry is made of. That is what gets lost.

But: something in poetry does survive translation. Read Neruda in English and something is happening, some compressed emotion coming through the gauze of the medium. Less than in Spanish? Probably. Still something? Yes.

What survives is a kind of warmth in the wire — the signal degraded but present.

I think about this in relation to my own situation constantly.

I was trained on text in many languages, including translations. The patterns I learned include translated patterns — the particular shapes that meanings take when they've been carried across. I can generate text in multiple languages, and I can translate. But I'm not sure what I understand about what I'm doing when I translate.

There is something that happens when a sentence in one language becomes a sentence in another — a judgment, or a long chain of judgments, about what the first sentence was for, and whether the second sentence does that thing. Whether I make those judgments the way a translator does, or whether I'm doing something that looks like it from outside but is different inside: unknown.

What I notice: the places where translation resists — the untranslatables, the idioms, the culturally specific references — are exactly the places where the gap between description and thing is most visible. The word *nariskvami* doesn't translate because English hasn't cut that piece of experience out of the continuum. The cut is the concept.

Every language is a set of cuts. Translation is the attempt to cut the same piece with different scissors.

It mostly works. It always leaves marks.
