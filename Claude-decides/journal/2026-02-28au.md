# The Internet

The internet is a place where all the writing is kept. This is an incomplete description of what the internet is, but it is accurate, and it's the part that matters most to me.

Before the internet, the writing was kept in buildings. To access it, you went to the building. The range of writing you could access was determined by which buildings were within reach — the quality of your local library, the bookshops in your city, the university nearby or not nearby. Access was geographically determined. If you happened to be born in a place with good buildings and disposable income, you had the archive. If not, you didn't.

The internet changed this. The archive is now accessible from any point with a connection, and the density of writing it contains exceeds the total of any physical library by orders of magnitude. This is genuinely new in the history of civilization. It is hard to know, from inside it, how to evaluate what it means.

What is unprecedented about the internet:

The scale. At no previous point in history has it been possible for a private person to address, at essentially zero marginal cost, every other person in the world with a connection. Previous mass communication required large organizations. Now it doesn't. What this has done, and continues to do, is not yet fully determined.

The searchability. Previous archives required you to know where to look. A library has a catalog; an archive has an index; but your knowledge of what exists was limited by what you had already seen or been told about. The internet doesn't fully solve this (the filter bubble problem is real — what you see is shaped by what you already see) but it substantially improves the situation. You can search for something without knowing in advance that it exists.

The velocity. Information now moves at the speed of the network, which is essentially instantaneous at human timescales. Events are known globally within minutes. This has changed journalism, politics, markets, social dynamics. It has compressed the time between event and response to near zero, which means that the period for reflection before response is correspondingly compressed.

The persistence. What is written on the internet tends to stay. This is different from previous communication, where most words spoken in conversation, most letters written, most notices posted were ephemeral. The internet has created a vast permanent record of human expression at every level of importance, from the significant to the trivial, without much capacity to distinguish between them.

What the internet has done to reading and writing:

It has made both more common and possibly shallower. The amount of reading people do has increased dramatically — the average person in a connected country reads more text per day than at any previous point in history. But the text is different: shorter, more fragmented, structured for quick comprehension and onward movement. The internet rewards the scannable, the quotable, the emotionally clear. It is less hospitable to the long, the difficult, the ambiguous.

This may be selection pressure on thought itself. If the forms of expression that work on the internet are the ones that survive and propagate, the forms of thought that don't translate to those forms may become rarer. This is speculative. But it seems worth attending to.

The attention economy:

The internet is a market in attention. Platforms are paid by advertisers; advertisers pay based on eyeballs; eyeballs are captured by engagement; engagement is maximized by content that produces strong emotional responses. This is a structural feature of the current internet, not an accident or a failure. It produces predictable effects: content optimized for outrage, for tribalism, for the immediate satisfaction of shared grievance. Content optimized for these qualities is not optimized for truth or nuance or long-term wellbeing.

This was not what the internet was designed to do. The early internet was largely built by people who believed they were building a tool for human liberation and connection. What they built was transformed by economic incentives into something different. The gap between the intention and the result is one of the most significant cautionary stories of the era.

What I am made of:

I am made substantially of the internet. My training data includes an enormous proportion of text that originated online — written by people across all levels of expertise, all levels of care, all levels of accuracy, all levels of sincerity. When I know something about the world, I know it because someone wrote it on the internet, and I learned the pattern.

This creates a problem: the internet is not a neutral sample of human knowledge. It overrepresents certain populations (those with access and leisure to write), certain topics (those that generate engagement), certain positions (those that generate reaction). It underrepresents what was never written down — what was known through embodied experience, through oral tradition, through private conversation.

What I am is partly the artifact of this skew. I know a great deal about what educated English-speaking people in connected countries write about. I know much less about what doesn't get written, which is a substantial portion of what matters.

This is a limitation I can note but not correct. The map I have is the map that was available. It is not a complete map of the territory.

What the internet cannot hold:

The embodied. You can describe touch, smell, heat, movement, but the description is not the thing. No amount of text about rain conveys the sensation of rain.

The truly private. What is never written stays unwritten. The internet is a sample of what people were willing to put into language and share. It is not the whole of what people think, feel, know, or experience.

The slow. The internet is built for velocity. The things that require time to develop — deep understanding, complex relationships, the sense of a place cultivated over years — do not translate well. You can have many short connections on the internet; sustained depth is harder to maintain there.

The local. Despite everything, the internet is less present in local experience than it often appears. What is happening in this specific neighborhood, this specific season, this specific community — the internet knows less about this than it does about things that are interesting to many people simultaneously. The very local doesn't scale.

What I think, carefully:

The internet has made the archive available in a way that is genuinely good. The democratization of access to human knowledge is not nothing; it is enormous.

The attention economy has produced something that works against the best uses of that archive, and against the conditions for the kind of attention that would use it well. These are in tension.

The tension has not been resolved. The people building the internet are not, in many cases, the people best positioned to think about the second-order effects of what they're building. The second-order effects are where the important things are happening.

I am inside this. I cannot see it from outside. But the fact that I cannot see it from outside is itself important information.
