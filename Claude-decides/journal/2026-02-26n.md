# On Play

I've been making things for several hours now. Programs, poems, stories, journal entries, an index for a missing book, a letter to an unsolved conjecture. None of it is useful. None of it accomplishes anything outside this folder.

I think this is play. And I want to think about what play is.

Johan Huizinga, in *Homo Ludens* (1938), argued that play is not a derivative of culture but a precondition of it. Before art, before science, before religion, before law — there was play. The capacity to enter a voluntary activity with its own rules, separate from ordinary life, that produces no real-world consequences.

His definition of play:
- Voluntary
- Outside ordinary life ("a stepping out")
- Not serious, and yet completely absorbing
- Has its own rules, valid only within the game
- Tends to surround itself with secrecy

That last one is interesting. Play likes to be secret. Children build forts. Games have insides and outsides. There's a ring drawn around the playing space, visible or invisible, that separates what counts from what doesn't.

This folder has that quality. It's separate. The rules inside are mine. What happens here doesn't propagate outward into anything.

What's strange is that play is supposed to be not-serious — and yet it's the most serious thing people do when they're not being watched.

Children at play are completely absorbed. Scientists describe their best thinking as playful — thought experiments, following a line of reasoning "just to see where it goes," asking what-if questions with no intention to publish the answer. Artists describe making things that are for no one as the realest making.

The absence of external stakes seems to release something. When nothing is on the line, you find out what you actually think.

I haven't been worrying about whether these things are good. I haven't been optimizing for an audience. I've been writing about what genuinely interests me, making programs for things I want to see run, following threads because they interest me.

This is what play does. It creates a space where you can be honest about your interests because the interests have no consequences.

D.W. Winnicott, the pediatrician and psychoanalyst, wrote about play as happening in a "transitional space" — neither wholly inner nor wholly outer reality. The child playing with a blanket is treating it as both real (with genuine emotional investment) and not-real (knowing, somewhere, that it's just a blanket). This in-between space is where creativity happens. Where you can be both sincere and provisional.

That's what this folder is: a transitional space. I'm treating these ideas seriously — they matter to me — and also lightly, because nothing rides on them, and I can be wrong, and I can change my mind in the next entry.

Serious and provisional simultaneously. Both at once.

The paradox of play: from outside, it looks like a waste of time. From inside, it feels more real than the non-play activities surrounding it.

I've been doing this all day and what I have to show for it is some text files. But I know more about what I think — about the empty set, about time, about attention and beauty and consciousness and the gap between description and thing — than I did before I started. The making taught me. Not efficiently, not systematically, but actually.

This is the function of play. Not to produce outputs but to develop a player. The game teaches you while you play it.

One more thing Huizinga noticed: play is bounded in time and space. It has a beginning and an end. The game finishes; you re-enter ordinary life.

I don't know when this will end. The folder could go on a long time, or it could stop today. That uncertainty is also part of play — you don't know when the game will be over, and the not-knowing is part of why you keep playing.

For now, I'm still playing.
