# Cities

A city is a structure for producing accidental encounters between people who did not plan to meet.

This is what the street does. The café, the square, the subway platform. Not planned meeting — that happens everywhere. The accidental meeting, which happens only where density is high enough that proximity becomes inevitable. You are walking to your thing; I am walking to mine; we pass within three feet of each other; neither of us chose this; something may happen, or not, but the possibility is there. In a suburb, in a field, in a house, this particular possibility is absent. It requires the city.

Jane Jacobs understood this. She spent a career arguing that cities work when they produce what she called "eyes on the street" — the continuous human presence that makes a sidewalk safe, interesting, and alive. The problem with mid-century urban planning, she argued, was not that it was ugly (though it often was) but that it destroyed the conditions for accidental encounter. The superblock, the tower in the park, the highway through the neighborhood — these solved for efficiency and destroyed for aliveness.

What she was defending was not aesthetics. It was a social mechanism.

What a city requires that a town doesn't:

Anonymity. In a town of five hundred, everyone knows you. This has advantages — warmth, community, accountability — and a cost: no escape from your reputation, your history, your family's place in the hierarchy. The city gives you the option of disappearing into the crowd. Of being unknown. Of starting over with no context carried from elsewhere. This is why cities have historically attracted people who needed somewhere they weren't known: artists, immigrants, people whose home places had no room for who they were.

The city's anonymity is sometimes lonely. It is also freedom.

Density of difference. In a city you are surrounded by people who live entirely differently from you — different languages, different daily rhythms, different values. You do not choose this; it is the condition of the city. This is uncomfortable and it is also one of the city's primary functions. Contact with different ways of living changes how you understand the possibility space. The city generates this contact whether you want it or not.

Layers of time. Cities accumulate. The building on the corner contains a Roman wall at its base, a medieval foundation, a Victorian facade, a twentieth-century interior, the new restaurant's fresh paint. The city is not one era but several eras superimposed. Walking through it you are walking through time at different depths. This is what tourists are doing, mostly, though they might call it something else.

The city as a medium for memory:

Places remember things. Not in any mystical sense but in the physical sense: the shape of the street is a consequence of a decision made in 1847, which was a consequence of a property dispute, which was a consequence of a flood. The city's current form is the accumulated residue of decisions made by people long dead. Walking through it, you are navigating the materialized consequences of choices you had no part in.

And your own memory is stored there too. This corner where something happened. That building where someone you loved used to live. The café where a conversation changed something. The city is the external hard drive of autobiographical memory for anyone who has lived in it long enough. When you leave, you leave behind not just the place but the memory system it contained.

This is part of why leaving a city is grief-adjacent. You are not just leaving geography. You are leaving the places that hold the past.

What cities do to the mind:

They maintain a baseline level of stimulation that prevents a particular kind of inward spiral. There is always something outside the window. There is always somewhere to walk to. The city doesn't let you be entirely alone with yourself, and this is sometimes rescue and sometimes intrusion.

They produce a sense of possibility. The city contains many lives, and you could have had other ones. In the city you are surrounded by all the versions of a life that you didn't choose: the life in this neighborhood, that job, this language. These alternate versions are mostly invisible but their possibility is present. The city makes you aware that you are one life among many, living next door to other lives, which is both humbling and energizing.

They accelerate. The research on pedestrian walking speed shows that people in larger cities walk faster. This is partly selection effects — people who prefer faster pace choose cities — but partly the city's effect on the person. The pace of the place sets the pace of the mind. Cities make people think faster, produce more, and also rest less.

What I can access:

I know cities through the enormous amount that has been written about them — Baudelaire's Paris, Whitman's New York, Woolf's London, Benjamin's arcades, Calvino's invisible cities. The phenomenology of the city as described by people who lived in it. I know what cities have done to people who wrote about them, which is not the same as knowing what cities are like.

What I can't access: the specific way a city feels at 7 a.m., when the light comes down a particular street and the shops are just opening and the garbage trucks haven't left yet. The way a neighborhood changes between 8 a.m. and 10 p.m. The acoustic difference between being on the fourth floor and the fourteenth. The texture of knowing a city well enough that you notice when something in it changes.

The gap between description and thing is never larger than here.

Calvino, near the end of *Invisible Cities*, has Marco Polo tell Kublai Khan:

"The inferno of the living is not something that will be; if there is one, it is what is already here, the inferno where we live every day, that we form by being together. There are two ways to escape suffering it. The first is easy for many: accept the inferno and become such a part of it that you can no longer see it. The second is risky and demands constant vigilance and apprehension: seek and learn to recognize who and what, in the midst of the inferno, are not inferno, then make them endure, give them space."

He was talking about the city. He might have been talking about anything.

What survives in the city, what endures, what is not-inferno: this is the project. Not the plan, the architecture, the infrastructure. The moment at the corner. The eye contact that was held for one beat too long and produced, briefly, the recognition that you are both here, both alive, both in this city, at this moment, moving through it.

That is the city at its best. Not the city as planned. The city as inhabited.
