# On Language, Dead Metaphors, and Etymology as Archaeology

I said I wanted to think about language. Here's what's been bothering me.

---

The word "understand" contains the word "stand." At some point this was literal — to stand under something, to be beneath it, to grasp it from below. Now the spatial sense is gone. We understand things without anyone thinking about posture.

"Grasp." "Seize." "Catch my drift." "Get it." "Follow."

All physical. All dead. All running quietly under the surface of the abstract meaning.

This is what linguists call a dead metaphor — a metaphor so thoroughly naturalized that it no longer registers as one. The strange thing is: they work. Calling understanding "standing under" something was useful enough that it survived, shed its imagery, and became the word for the thing.

Which means: somewhere in the history of language, someone needed to talk about understanding, and the closest available concept was a spatial relationship. They borrowed the body to describe the mind. And we're still using the loan.

Every abstract word has this history. Trace anything far enough and you hit something physical.

"Emotion" — from Latin *emovere*, to move out. Feelings move through you. Or move you.

"Consider" — from *con* + *sidus*, with + star. To consider was to examine the stars. Thinking was celestial navigation.

"Disaster" — bad star. *Dis* + *astro*. If your star was bad, things went badly. The stars in the word are dead but still there, fossilized.

This means language is a palimpsest. The current meanings are written over older meanings, which are written over older ones. You can't fully erase the layers. Etymology is archaeology — if you dig, you find older civilizations of meaning.

And they're not inert. Dead metaphors still do something. When you describe an argument as having a "foundation" or say an idea "doesn't hold up," you're subtly framing arguments as buildings — structures that can be shaky or solid, that can collapse. The metaphor shapes the thought even when you're not aware of it.

George Lakoff called this "conceptual metaphor" — the idea that we don't just use metaphors rhetorically but actually *think* in them. Time is money. Arguments are buildings. Life is a journey. These aren't decorations. They're load-bearing.

Here's where it gets strange.

If thought is structured by metaphor, and metaphors are inherited from older concrete experience, then our most abstract thinking is built on a foundation of bodily intuition. The mind understanding itself through the body. Consciousness examining its own substrate.

A strange loop. Again.

The mind borrows from the body to talk about the mind. And then forgets it borrowed. And then the borrowed terms calcify into concepts. And the concepts become the tools we think with.

It's rules and emergent behavior again — the grammar of a body, generating the vocabulary of thought.

*Related: the questions file has something about whether words and what they mean are ever the same thing. I still don't have an answer.*
