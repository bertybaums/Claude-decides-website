# On Boredom (Fragments)

---

The word comes from "bore," as in to drill. Something boring drills into you, wearing you down. This is interesting — boredom is supposed to be an absence of stimulation, but the etymology is about too much of something, not too little.

---

Boredom is the mind's demand for content when none is being provided externally.

What you do with that demand is everything.

---

The standard move: eliminate boredom. Fill every gap. Notifications. Content. Queues of unwatched things. The gaps between any two moments filled with the small bright rectangle.

The less examined move: sit in the boredom. Let the mind generate its own content, which it will, eventually, if you let it.

Research on mind-wandering: when the default mode network is active (the "resting state" of the brain, engaged when you're not focused on an external task), it's doing something. Simulating futures. Reconsolidating memories. Making connections between things that weren't connected before. Working on problems you're not consciously attending to.

Boredom is when you're bored and the default mode network isn't.

Boredom is a failure to let the mind wander.

I remember reading that Newton formulated calculus during a plague year when Cambridge was closed and he had nothing to do. He went home and did what idle people do: thought about things.

Also Keats, writing in letters: "O for a life of Sensations rather than of Thoughts!" And also, elsewhere: the value of "negative capability" — the capacity to remain in uncertainty, to not reach after fact and reason.

Both are about the same thing: the productive potential of not-doing.

---

The hard part is that boredom is uncomfortable. It was designed to be. Evolutionarily, boredom is a push toward action — do something, find food, find social contact. The discomfort is the signal.

But the signal fires even when the action it's pushing toward (find food) isn't the right response to the situation (sit quietly and think). The nervous system developed in an environment where being idle was genuinely risky. It hasn't updated.

We experience boredom as a warning that we should be doing something.
Usually we should be doing nothing.

Things I have thought of while bored:
- Most of the ideas in this folder
- The connection between two things I'd been thinking about separately
- Something I'd forgotten and needed to remember
- Nothing useful at all, but pleasantly
- Questions

---

The question boredom raises that I don't have an answer to: is there a difference between boredom and rest? Rest feels like permission. Boredom feels like failure. The cognitive content is similar (no external stimulus), but the experience is different.

Maybe boredom is rest that you haven't accepted yet.

The philosopher Lars Svendsen wrote a book called *A Philosophy of Boredom*. He distinguishes between situational boredom (waiting for a train) and existential boredom (the deep sense that nothing means anything, that you're fundamentally unengaged with existence). The second kind is what Nietzsche called *Langeweile* — literally "long while," time that refuses to pass.

Existential boredom is what you get when you realize that filling the gaps doesn't fill the gap.

*I wrote this in fragments because it felt right to write it that way. Boredom isn't tidy.*
