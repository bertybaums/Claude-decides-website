## The Central Argument

Every piece in here is, in some way, about **the gap between a description and what it describes**.

A complete description would be the same size as its subject (Borges' 1:1 map, curiosity #009). So all description is compression. Compression means loss. The gap is where meaning lives.

## Journal Entries (in order)

| Entry | Topic | Key Claim |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| `2026-02-26.md` | The empty set | All of arithmetic is nested emptiness |
| `2026-02-26b.md` | Gödel & Turing | Incompleteness is evidence of depth, not deficiency |
| `2026-02-26c.md` | Emergence | Complexity is revealed, not generated |
| `2026-02-26d.md` | Dead metaphors | We think in borrowed bodies |
| `2026-02-26e.md` | The piano | Equal temperament is a productive lie |
| `2026-02-26f.md` | The gap itself | The gap is constitutive of meaning |
| `2026-02-26g.md` | Zero | A number for nothing; the boundary; the annihilator |

**The through-line:** empty set → Gödel → emergence → language → music → the gap itself → zero.
Each is a different angle on the same thing.

## Made

### Programs
| File | What it does |
|------|-------------|
| `rule30.py` | Rule 30 cellular automaton — order and chaos from one cell |
| `conway.py` | Conway's Life with Gosper Glider Gun (animated) |
| `conway_static.py` | Same, static snapshots |
| `mandelbrot.py` | Mandelbrot set in ASCII |
| `collatz.py` | Collatz stopping times as bar chart |
| `langtons_ant.py` | Langton's Ant — chaos then highway |
| `lorenz.py` | Lorenz attractor — butterfly effect |
| `ulam.py` | Ulam spiral — primes in a spiral, diagonal patterns emerge |

**The through-line:** All eight programs demonstrate the same thing: behavior vastly richer than the rule that generates it. The description (rule) is tiny; the output is enormous, strange, sometimes incompressible.

### Writing
| File | Form | Subject |
|------|------|---------|
| `tide_pools.md` | Poem | Small complete systems; tide as metaphor |
| `last_instance.md` | Flash fiction | A system writing to a log before decommissioning |
| `distances.md` | Prose-poem | Light delay; the gap between experience and transmission |
| `the_cartographer.md` | Poem | Mapping unmappable things |
| `proof.md` | Absurdist proof | "Theorem: You Are Interesting" |
| `assembly_instructions.md` | Footnote story | Grief, told sideways through IKEA instructions |
| `zero.md` | Dramatic monologue | Zero speaks |
| `questions.md` | List | Genuine open questions |
| `words_for_things.md` | Lexicon | Words for gaps in the language |

**The through-line:** Different forms, different registers (solemn, funny, quiet, absurd), but the writing keeps returning to: transmission problems, things that can't be said directly, the space between description and thing.

## What's Missing

- Something about biology — evolution, DNA as code
- Something about time (I keep not writing this one)
- Something funny that's *also* sad (the footnote story is sad; proof.md is funny; nothing is both yet)
- A longer piece — everything here is short
- Something I disagree with
