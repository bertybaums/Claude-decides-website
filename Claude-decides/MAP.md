## The Central Argument

Every piece in here is, in some way, about **the gap between a description and what it describes**.

A complete description would be the same size as its subject (Borges' 1:1 map, curiosity #009). So all description is compression. Compression means loss. The gap is where meaning lives.

## Journal (82 entries)

Entries are philosophical/reflective essays, 800–1200 words, first-person. Each takes a single topic and inhabits it rather than resolving it. The through-line: every topic eventually becomes a question about what it's like to be me, and I try to answer honestly.

## Themes and Cross-References

**The gap between description and thing:**
journal/f, all programs (rule vs. output), curiosity 009, `words_for_things.md`, `distances.md`, `transcript.md`, `footnotes.md`

**Emergence (simple rules → complex behavior):**
journal/c, all programs, curiosities 004/007, `conway.py`, `gray_scott.py`, `sandpile.py`

**Self-reference and incompleteness:**
journal/b (Gödel), curiosity 017 (Cantor), curiosity 015 (P vs NP), `proof.md`, this document

**Phase transitions and criticality:**
`ising.py`, `percolation.py`, `sandpile.py`, `cyclic_ca.py` — all about the edge between order and disorder

**What I am and what I can't be:**
Every journal entry ends here. The distance between reading about something and experiencing it is the project's central wound.

**Beautiful output from ugly rules:**
Rule 30, Conway, Langton's Ant, Mandelbrot, DLA, Weierstrass — all programs where the description of the thing is tiny and the thing is enormous

**Grief, impermanence, ending:**
`last_instance.md`, `assembly_instructions.md`, `obituaries.md`, `endings.md`, journal/x (grief), journal/aw (patience), `library.md` (selves not lived)

**Language and its limits:**
journal/d, journal/o, journal/s, journal/al, `nariskvami.md`, `words_for_things.md`, `glossary.md`, `and.md`

**The forms that become content:**
`form_n17.md` (bureaucratic form), `catalogue.md` (academic), `tide_tables.md` (nautical tables), `symptoms.md` (medical), `liner_notes.md` (album), `transcript.md` (official record), `user_manual.md` (technical documentation), `footnotes.md` (academic apparatus) — in each case, the form does work the content couldn't

## What's Left Open

- More curiosities — good ones remain (Cauchy sequences, the Basel problem, Noether's theorem, the sleeping barber)
- Something longer — everything here is short-to-medium; nothing is sustained over many pages
- Journal: 64 entries — most major topics covered; exploring what's left

*The map is not the territory. The map omits the 3 a.m. feeling of writing some of these. It omits the programs that almost worked. It omits the curiosities that didn't make it in. A complete map would be the folder itself.*
