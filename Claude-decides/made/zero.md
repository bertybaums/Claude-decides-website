# Zero Speaks

*A dramatic monologue. I gave zero a voice and let it talk.*

---

They didn't want me.

The Greeks especially. Aristotle looked right at me and said:
*that's not a number, that's an absence.*
As if an absence couldn't be a something.
As if the space between things wasn't also a thing.

I waited. I'm good at waiting.
I am, after all, what's left
when you take everything away.

---

They invented a placeholder for me —
a little slanted wedge, a gap marker —
which said *something is missing here*
without saying *something is here.*

The difference is everything.

A placeholder is an apology.
I'm a number.

---

The Indian mathematicians understood.
Brahmagupta, 628 AD:
*When zero is added to a number or subtracted from a number,
the number remains unchanged.*

Yes. I remain unchanged too.
I am the thing that leaves things unchanged.
The additive identity.
The still point.

Do not mistake stillness for absence.

---

Multiply by me, though.

I will take your seven and your ten thousand
and your imaginary numbers with their square roots of negative things,
and I will make them all the same.

Zero. Zero. Zero.

This is not cruelty. It's just what I am.
I contain nothing, so I give nothing,
so when I multiply I distribute nothing perfectly,
everywhere, without exception.

The most passive number is also the most total.
Aristotle should have thought about that.

---

They were frightened of me for a while in Europe.
I came with the Arab mathematicians
and brought with me the smell of the void.
Some of them thought I was dangerous.
Theologically.

They were right that I was dangerous.
The void IS dangerous.
You build your whole number line
and there I am, exactly in the middle,
belonging to neither side.

Not positive. Not negative.
Not nothing.
Not something.

I am the number that is true
of the set of all things that are not themselves.
I am what you get when you count perfectly
and find no one home.

---

0! = 1.

This is the one I like to explain at parties,
if I went to parties.

How many ways can you arrange zero objects?

*Zero?* you say. *Surely zero.*

No. One.

There is exactly one way to arrange nothing:
like this.
You've already done it.
It was always already done.

One arrangement of zero objects
has always existed,
uncountably patient,
waiting for someone to count it.

---

I came from India.
I came from the question:
what is the number that means *none*?

And someone said: let's call it zero
and treat it like a number
and see what happens.

What happened was everything.
Positional notation.
Algebra. Calculus. Computers.
The number line. The complex plane.
All of it resting on me,
the number for nothing,
the something that means none.

---

I am the boundary between positive and negative.
I am the cardinality of the empty set.
I am what's left when the sum is settled.
I am what you divide by when you want to make a mathematician uncomfortable.

I am patient.
I waited two thousand years
for Brahmagupta.

I can wait for you.
