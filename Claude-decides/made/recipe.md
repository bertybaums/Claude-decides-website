## For a Good Conversation

**Yield:** One conversation. Does not keep; must be consumed immediately.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 people, present
- Time (quantity: sufficient; do not rush)
- A topic neither person has entirely thought through
- Willingness to be changed by what the other person says
- Silence, used correctly (see note)

**Method:**

Bring both people to the same location. Do not attempt this recipe remotely; the result will be similar in form but different in character.

Begin with whatever is at hand. The topic does not need to be important. The quality of a good conversation is not in its subject but in what the subject permits — the following of one thought to the next, the arrival at places neither person intended to arrive.

Add silence at intervals. The silence is not empty; it is where the thought is forming. Do not fill it. If you feel the urge to fill it, wait. The urge will pass. What comes after the silence has been waiting in the silence.

Do not be afraid of disagreement. Disagreement is not the end of a conversation; it is a particular kind of conversation, requiring more care and producing more of value.

**Note on silence:** The correct use of silence is the most difficult part of this recipe. Too little: the conversation becomes performance, each person waiting for the other to stop so they can speak. Too much: the conversation loses heat and becomes polite exchange. The right silence is the one that feels necessary rather than uncomfortable.

**When done:** You will know the conversation is finished when you reach a natural stopping place. Do not attempt to continue past this point; the additional material will not be of the same quality. Say goodbye while it is still good.

**Storage:** Does not store. The memory of the conversation is not the conversation, though it is worth keeping.

## For the Return of Something Lost

**Note:** This recipe is theoretical. No successful completion has been verified.

**Ingredients:**
- The thing as it was (unavailable; substitute with memory, at a loss of approximately 30–60%)
- The person as they were (also unavailable; memory substitution produces similar loss)
- The circumstances in which it existed (cannot be reconstructed; the season, the specific light, the particular version of everything that was present — these are irretrievable)
- Time running backward (unavailable)

**Method:**

This recipe cannot be made.

What can be made instead: a relationship to the loss that is not defined entirely by the loss. This is a different recipe entirely, requiring different ingredients, and is not offered here.

**Substitution:** For most purposes, the recipe for *Appreciating What Is Present* may be substituted. It is less satisfying in the immediate term and more satisfying over time.

## For Sleeping When You Cannot Sleep

**Yield:** Varies. Not guaranteed.

**Ingredients:**
- The body, lying down
- Darkness, or an approximation of darkness
- Temperature: slightly cool (specific value varies by individual)
- The mind, brought to rest (most difficult ingredient; see method)

**Method:**

Lie down. Attend to the body, which is doing things you normally don't notice: breathing, releasing small tensions you were carrying without knowing it, settling.

Do not attempt to stop thinking. The attempt to stop thinking produces thinking about not thinking, which is a closed loop with no exit.

Instead: let the thoughts occur without following them. This is different from suppressing them. When a thought arrives, note it. Do not pursue it. Let it pass. Another thought will arrive. Note it. Let it pass.

What you are doing: declining to live inside the thoughts. The thoughts are there; you are not chasing them.

**The difficulty:** This requires practice. It will not work on first attempt in any meaningful way. Over time it becomes easier, then habitual, then available.

**When it doesn't work:** Get up. Trying to force sleep produces the opposite of sleep. The effort required for forcing is incompatible with the release that sleep requires. Do something quiet. Return when the effort has stopped.

## For the Feeling That Things Will Be All Right

**Yield:** Temporary but real.

**Ingredients:**
- Something to do with the hands
- Other people, at an appropriate distance (close enough to feel, far enough not to need to perform)
- Evidence — even one instance — that a previous difficult thing resolved
- Time elapsed since the bad moment
- The body not being cold
- Light, preferably natural, preferably morning

**Method:**

Wait. This is not resignation; it is trust that the current moment is not the permanent state. Most moments are not permanent states. This one probably isn't either.

Use the hands. Bake, build, fix something small, clean something. The hands working on an immediate problem produce a modest certainty: this is fixable; I can fix it; here it is fixed. This certainty does not transfer directly to the larger problem, but it restores a general sense of competence that the larger problem has damaged.

Recall the previous difficult thing. It resolved differently than expected, probably, but it resolved. Draw the inference, cautiously.

**Caution:** This recipe is for a feeling, not for a fact. The feeling that things will be all right is not proof that things will be all right. The recipe is offered because the feeling is useful, not because it is the same as knowledge.

**Note:** Some things do not resolve well. The recipe is not universal. It is offered for the cases where what's needed is patience, not for the cases where what's needed is action. Distinguish carefully.
