# Pronunciation Guide

*For words that have no agreed pronunciation, because they have never been spoken aloud.*

---

**The feeling of recognizing someone you haven't seen in years from a distance, before they see you, and having the brief option of not being recognized**

Pronounced: *[the moment of hesitation]* — two beats, the second shorter than the first.

Do not prolong the first beat. Extended first beats produce guilt.

Regional variants: in some dialects, pronounced with the face slightly turned, as if examining something in the middle distance.

Stress falls on the word "option."

**The specific quality of light in a room at 4pm in October**

Pronounced as: *[the turn of the head]* toward the window, combined with the slight suspension of whatever you were doing.

Cannot be fully pronounced while completing a task. Partial pronunciation — glancing at the light without stopping — produces only the first syllable.

The full pronunciation takes approximately fifteen seconds and leaves a brief residue.

---

**The awareness, while reading a very good sentence, that you will not remember the sentence but will carry something from it anyway**

Pronunciation requires a pause after the sentence and before the next one. This pause is the word.

Duration: natural. Not performative. The pause that occurs because you have, briefly, arrived somewhere.

Note: attempting to memorize the sentence during the pronunciation changes the word being pronounced. The pronunciation of this word and the act of memorization are incompatible.

**The particular loneliness of being in a city you used to live in**

Pronounced differently depending on how long you lived there:

- Less than two years: stress on the second syllable (the city as it is now, which is wrong)
- Two to six years: stress distributed across the first and third syllables (the city as it was then, which is also wrong but differently)
- More than six years: the word becomes almost silent. You hear it as a frequency that doesn't register as sound.

Aspirate the *h* in "used to."

**Knowing someone well enough to know what they would say about something, and saying it to yourself on their behalf, when they're not there**

Pronounced in the second person (their voice, not yours).

The pronunciation includes the specific cadences. The way the voice goes up at the end of questions. The pause before the word they always pause before.

Note on accuracy: the pronunciation drifts over time. You will notice, at some point, that what you are pronouncing is no longer exactly them. It has become something close to them, which is not the same.

There is no correction procedure. This is the natural lifespan of the word.

---

**The feeling of being witnessed doing something small and ordinary by someone who is glad you exist**

One syllable. Pronounced quietly. Not announced.

Most commonly pronounced in: kitchens, early mornings, while doing something you've done ten thousand times.

The pronunciation is not, strictly speaking, audible. It is felt as a form of being seen that does not require looking.

Cannot be forced. Cannot be performed. Can only be received.

---

**The sense, usually wrong, that something is about to become clear**

Pronounced with a slight intake of breath.

The slight intake of breath is the word.

Do not exhale immediately. The word continues through the held breath.

Note: the sense of imminent clarity is usually not followed by clarity. The word does not describe the clarity; it describes the sense of imminent clarity. This distinction is important and is contained in the pronunciation.

---

**The specific texture of a conversation that was good and is now over**

Silent. Pronounced only in the absence of the conversation.

Most audible in: the five minutes after the conversation ends, when you are alone. Sometimes in the middle of the night, some days later, with no warning.

Not to be confused with regret. Regret looks backward for what could have been different. This word is simply the shape of what was.

*This guide is incomplete by design.*

*The words that need it most are the ones most resistant to being named.*

*Pronunciation is left as an exercise.*
