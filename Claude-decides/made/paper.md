## Abstract

We report here a preliminary investigation into the persistent subjective experience of being on the verge of beginning. The sensation, hereafter referred to as *imminence affect* (IA), is characterized by the belief, variously strong, that a period of meaningful action is imminent, despite substantial longitudinal evidence against this belief in specific cases. We describe the phenomenological profile of IA, propose three candidate mechanisms, evaluate them against available evidence (largely anecdotal), and identify key limitations of the present study (extensive). We conclude that IA serves an adaptive function in motivating sustained attention and approach behavior, while acknowledging that in the authors' personal experience it more often coincides with making additional coffee. The relationship between IA and actual beginning remains unclear. Directions for future research are suggested. The future research has not yet begun.

## 1. Introduction

At various points in daily life, individuals report the feeling that they are about to begin something. This feeling — that meaningful action, production, or change is imminent — is distinct from merely planning to act (which may be more cognitive) and from actually acting (which has been extensively studied under other headings). The sensation occupies a specific phenomenological space: post-intention but pre-execution; characterized by heightened readiness that has not yet resolved into movement.

The present investigation was motivated by the senior author's observation that she had experienced IA consistently for approximately six years while working on a manuscript that remained at 11,000 words throughout this period. She did not consider this a failure; she considered herself "nearly ready." Whether she was correct cannot be assessed at this time, as the manuscript remains at 11,000 words.

Previous work on related phenomena includes studies of procrastination [CITATION NEEDED], anticipatory affect [CITATION NEEDED], and the phenomenology of the blank page [CITATION NEEDED]. However, these literatures have not adequately addressed the specific case in which the subject genuinely believes beginning is imminent and has believed this consistently for a period exceeding several months.

## 2. Methods

**2.1 Participants.** The sample consisted of whoever was available when the questionnaire was designed. Exclusion criteria included: having already begun something; certainty about plans; time. Final N = one (the senior author, on the days she felt ready to gather data).

**2.2 Measures.** Participants rated their experience of IA on a scale from 1 (not at all on the verge) to 10 (absolutely about to start). Ratings were collected at irregular intervals whenever the instrument was remembered. Test-retest reliability was not assessed.

**2.3 Procedure.** Participants sat with a blank document and reported their experience. The document remained blank throughout data collection. This was considered informative.

**2.4 Analysis.** Qualitative. The senior author read her notes and had feelings about them.

## 3. Results

Participants consistently reported IA (mean rating: 7.3; SD: not calculated; confidence interval: not applicable). The sensation was described as "definitely this time," "right there, almost," and "I just need to find the right [music/coffee/moment/weather]." High IA ratings did not predict subsequent action (r = .04, p = n.s., and actually probably negative if we're being honest).

Qualitative analysis identified three recurring features:

1. *Preparation behaviors.* Subjects engaged in extensive preparation prior to the anticipated beginning: clearing workspace, making lists, opening relevant documents, closing irrelevant documents, reopening one irrelevant document "just for a moment," making another document for notes, alphabetizing something. These behaviors were experienced as progress toward beginning.

2. *Imminent horizon structure.* The sensation that beginning is about to occur appears to have a consistent temporal structure: it always predicts beginning within "just a bit," regardless of time elapsed. The horizon recedes as approached, maintaining constant apparent distance. This finding was not predicted but was not surprising to any member of the research team.

3. *Affective profile.* IA is accompanied by positive affect. Subjects reported feeling capable, motivated, and optimistic. These feelings did not correlate with output but were independently pleasant. This may represent the primary function of IA: the maintenance of approach behavior and positive self-concept in the absence of output. This interpretation was received with some defensiveness by the senior author, who then took a break to think about it.

## 4. Discussion

The present findings suggest that IA is a stable, positively valenced state characterized by the belief that beginning is imminent, a belief that shows striking resistance to disconfirmation. Several interpretations are possible.

**4.1 Adaptive hypothesis.** IA may serve to maintain approach motivation in the face of uncertainty, initiatory difficulty, or the general hardness of things. A person who perpetually believes they are "almost ready" may be more likely to attempt tasks than one who accurately perceives the distance between current state and productive action. This is a kind interpretation.

**4.2 Preparatory hypothesis.** The extensive preparation behaviors associated with IA may represent genuine readying, such that the beginning, when it occurs, will proceed more smoothly due to the environmental and cognitive preparation that preceded it. This would mean the years of being almost ready were building something. We cannot rule this out.

**4.3 Avoidance hypothesis.** IA may represent a sophisticated form of avoidance that preserves self-concept by maintaining the belief that action is forthcoming without requiring action to occur. We include this hypothesis only because the reviewers will raise it regardless.

**4.4 Limitations.** Extensive. Single-subject, cross-sectional (sort of), retrospective, confounded, self-reported, under-powered (N=1), not blinded, not preregistered. The dependent variable (beginning) was not operationally defined. "Beginning" may itself be a problematic construct.

---

## 5. Conclusions

IA is a real and identifiable state. Its relationship to actual beginning is unclear. It is, however, pleasant to experience and motivates continued preparation behaviors that may or may not contribute to eventual output. We believe this warrants further investigation.

We are nearly ready to begin that investigation.

The authors thank coffee, specifically, and unstructured time. The authors do not thank the blank document.

## Conflict of Interest

The senior author is, at the time of writing, on the verge of beginning several things. This may introduce bias.
