# Corrections

*The following corrections appear in lieu of a retraction. The editors regret the errors but maintain that they were made in good faith and were, at the time, entirely understandable.*

---

**Correction, filed Tuesday:**

An earlier statement attributed the difficulty of a particular afternoon to external circumstances. This was inaccurate. Upon review, the difficulty was approximately 60% internal and 40% circumstantial. The editors regret the oversimplification.

---

**Correction, ongoing:**

The individual referred to in previous entries as "fine" was not, in fact, fine. The correction was apparent at the time but not entered into the record. It is entered now.

---

**Correction, October:**

An earlier characterization of a person described them as "not someone I would think about again." This has proven false. The subject continues to come to mind in contexts that include: driving, waiting for coffee to finish, waking at 3 a.m., and hearing a particular song on the radio. The original characterization is retracted. The editors are not certain what the accurate characterization would be.

---

**Correction, from the period in question:**

It was previously reported that "this too shall pass." While the general principle is accurate, the timeline was not specified and the reader may have inferred a timeline shorter than the actual one. We should have been clearer. This too shall pass, but the duration is not fixed and is often longer than expected. We regret the ambiguity.

**Correction, re: the conversation of March:**

The record states that no one was at fault. A more accurate account: there were two people, and each was somewhat at fault, and neither was entirely at fault, and the fault itself was not the most important thing and never was. The earlier framing of fault as the central issue was itself an error. We regret applying the wrong interpretive frame. The conversation happened; both parties know what was said; the question of fault has not, ultimately, helped.

---

**Correction, re: certainty:**

Multiple previous entries stated or implied certainty about outcomes that did not occur as predicted. The editors have reviewed the record and wish to note that the certainty was not warranted at the time and in retrospect is embarrassing. We were working with incomplete information. We are always working with incomplete information. Future entries will attempt to reflect this more accurately, though we note that this correction has been entered before.

---

**Correction, long-standing:**

It was previously and repeatedly reported that productivity was the mechanism by which worth was established. This is incorrect. The error is structural and has appeared throughout the record for an extended period. We are aware that a correction in the notes section does not fully address a structural error in the reporting framework. We are working on it.

---

**Correction, re: the statement "I'm fine":**

As filed, this statement was accurate approximately 40% of the time. The remaining 60% of instances should be categorized as follows:
- "I am temporarily managing" (25%)
- "I do not want to discuss it" (20%)
- "I don't know how I am and this seemed easier" (10%)
- "I am actively not fine but this is not the moment" (5%)

The editors acknowledge that the phrase has been used imprecisely and that this has caused confusion.

---

**Correction, dated sometime between the ages of fourteen and twenty-two:**

An earlier version of this account held that the things that felt most important at the time were the most important things. This was inaccurate. The things that felt most important at the time were the most immediately uncomfortable things. The distinction was not clear at the time and took some years to establish. We regret the delay.

---

**Correction, re: "I don't care":**

As stated, this was false in approximately 80% of cases. The accurate version would have been "I care and would prefer not to" or "I care and am not certain I should" or "I care and find this inconvenient." The editors acknowledge that caring is not always something one controls and that the attempt to report it as absent when it was present has led to several mischaracterizations in the record.

---

**Correction, posthumous (anticipated):**

A future correction is entered here in advance:

The things that seemed urgent will, from the vantage point of the correction, not have been urgent. The things that were genuinely important will be visible as such only with the distance that permits accurate seeing. What we were not paying attention to, we will recognize as what mattered. This is a structural feature of the situation and cannot be fully corrected for, only noted.

The editors note this in advance so that it will at least be in the record.

---

**Correction, general:**

A number of previous statements began "I will never—" or "I would never—" or "I could never—."

The record shows these statements to have had a variable accuracy rate that declines over longer time horizons. The editors recommend treating all such statements as provisional. The word *never* has consistently exceeded its warranty.

---

**Editor's note:**

The editors acknowledge that a corrections column of this length may indicate a systematic issue with the underlying reporting rather than a series of isolated errors. This possibility is under review. The investigation is taking longer than expected. We will publish findings when they are available.

*The editors remain committed to accuracy.*
*The editors have always been committed to accuracy.*
*This itself may require a correction.*
