# Tide Tables
## Selected Emotional and Cognitive Stations
## Annual Edition

*Predicted tides. Actual tides may vary due to local conditions, wind, weather, atmospheric pressure, and what happened three weeks ago that you haven't fully processed yet. Heights given in subjective units (su). High tide: maximum felt intensity. Low tide: minimum.*

## Station 1: Grief

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| First weeks | Continuous | 4.8 su | High, sustained |
| Month 2 | Variable | 3.1 su | Irregular; gaps appear |
| Month 4 | Unpredictable | 0.4–4.2 su | Mixed; triggers create sudden highs |
| Month 8 | 3:00–4:30 a.m. | 3.8 su | Nocturnal high |
| Year 1 | Anniversary ±3 days | 4.5 su | Seasonal high |
| Year 2 | Intermittent | 1.2–3.5 su | Background with peaks |
| Year 5 | Monthly | 0.8 su | Moderate; predictable |
| Ongoing | Indefinite | 0.3 su | Minimum, sustained |

**Note:** Grief does not end; the minimum does not reach zero. This is not a flaw in the tide table. The minimum represents the persistence of the relationship, which does not end because the person does.

**Warning:** Specific songs, smells, and domestic objects may produce tide surges not reflected in these predictions. The tide table cannot account for these. Prepare accordingly.

## Station 2: Creative Work (When Going Well)

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Initial phase | Hours 1–2 | 0.5 su | Rising; slow |
| Entry point | Hours 2–3 | 2.8 su | Threshold crossing |
| Flow state | Hours 3–5 | 4.1 su | High; sustained |
| Interruption | Upon interruption | -0.2 su | Abrupt drop; difficult to recover |
| Post-session | Immediate | 3.2 su | Residual high |
| Next morning | 6:00 a.m. | 3.8 su | Characteristic morning high; use immediately |
| After rest | Varies | 2.1 su | Moderate; accessible with effort |
| Fallow period | Multi-day | 0.1 su | Low; do not force |

**Note:** The morning high following a productive day is reliable and should be exploited. Attempting to extend sessions past hour 5 typically produces falling tides that resist recovery. The fallow period is not failure; it is part of the tidal cycle.

## Station 3: New Love

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Days 1–14 | Continuous | 4.7 su | Sustained high; attention fragmented |
| Month 1 | Waking | 4.2 su | Morning highs dominant |
| Month 1 | Separation | 3.9 su | Elevation on absence |
| Month 2 | First difficulty | Variable | Mixed; may include lows |
| Month 3 | Stabilizing | 3.0 su | Base rises; peaks reduce |
| Month 6 | Ongoing | 2.4 su | High maintained; accessible |
| Year 1 | Varies | 1.8–3.6 su | Full range; deeper structure emerging |

**Note:** The peak heights of months 1–2 are not sustainable by biological design. The reduction to 3.0 su in month 3 is not a decline; it is normalization to a level at which functioning is possible. Do not mistake the normalization for loss.

**Warning:** Station readings may be affected by proximity to the object of the tide. Separation amplifies. Presence sometimes stabilizes, sometimes intensifies. The behavior is nonlinear.

## Station 4: The 3 a.m. Problem

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Any night | 3:00–4:30 a.m. | 4.8 su | Reliable high; recurs |

**Note:** The 3 a.m. problem tidal station is the most consistent in this table. Tides at this station are elevated by: biological factors (cortisol cycle, light reduction), situational factors (absence of distraction, inability to act on anything until morning), and cognitive factors (the 3 a.m. tendency to treat unsolvable problems as solvable if sufficient attention is applied).

Problems reviewed at this station appear larger than they are. This is a measurement artifact, not a true reading. Recommended response: note the reading without acting on it; record it if useful; wait for morning. Morning readings are typically 40–60% lower for equivalent problems.

The station does not close.

## Station 5: Reconnection After Absence

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Reunion, hours 0–1 | Immediate | 3.9 su | Initial high |
| Hours 1–4 | Settling | 2.6 su | Drop to baseline |
| Day 2 | Normal pattern | 2.3 su | Restored baseline |
| Day 3–7 | Sustained | 2.3 su | Stable; as-before |

**Note:** The initial elevation at reunion is real but brief. Do not plan important conversations for the first hour. The settling is not rejection; it is normalization. The restored baseline is often higher than the pre-absence baseline, a result of the accumulated anticipation now returned to presence.

The absence did something. The reunion is not the reversal of absence; it is the arrival at the place absence was leading to.

## Station 6: The Work That Is Not Working

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Hour 1 | Beginning | 1.2 su | Low but acceptable |
| Hour 2 | Continued effort | 0.8 su | Dropping |
| Hour 3 | Recognition | 0.2 su | Low tide |
| Persistence past hour 3 | Continued | -0.1 su | Below baseline; counterproductive |
| After rest (minimum 8 hours) | Return | 1.4 su | Partial recovery |
| After rest (24 hours) | Return | 2.2 su | Substantial recovery |
| After abandonment and return | Variable | 2.6 su | Highest recovery; requires genuine separation |

**Note:** This table describes the single most consistent finding in this edition: continued effort past low tide does not produce recovery. Only genuine rest and distance produce recovery. The 24-hour reading is consistently higher than the 8-hour reading. The abandonment-and-return reading is highest of all.

**Recommendation:** Leave. Not forever. For the prescribed interval. Return when the table indicates. Do not fight the tide.

## Station 7: Being Understood

| Date | Time | Height | Type |
|------|------|--------|------|
| Recognition | Immediate | 4.6 su | Sudden high; characteristic spike |
| Duration | 2–20 minutes | 3.8–4.2 su | Sustained; duration variable |
| Aftermath | Hours | 2.9 su | Elevated baseline; residual |
| Memory | Long-term | 1.4 su | Accessible; remains elevated above base |

**Note:** The station labeled "Being Understood" is rare relative to its height. Most tidal stations produce reliable, predictable readings. This station produces high readings infrequently and without consistent scheduling.

The unpredictability is not a problem to solve. It is the condition of the station. You cannot force the tide here. You can only be present when the conditions produce it.

**Long-term note:** Relationships in which this station produces high readings regularly are measurably different from those in which it does not. The station's readings are a useful indicator of the quality of a relational environment.
