# A Glossary of Second Thoughts

*Definitions for the thoughts that arrive after the fact.*

---

**the arrival** *(n.)* The moment you think of what you should have said. Distinct from the original silence, which was merely empty, by the presence of the perfect response now available. The arrival typically occurs: in the shower; while falling asleep; on the drive home; as the door closes. Named for the fact that it always comes, always too late. The French have a term for this — *l'esprit de l'escalier*, the wit of the staircase — but this dictionary uses the simpler English.

---

**belated clarity** *(n.)* The experience of suddenly understanding, three weeks after the argument, exactly what the argument was about. Belated clarity arrives with the quality of revelation and the timing of a missing train. The understanding is accurate and useful and roughly timed to when it cannot help.

---

**the counter-decision** *(n.)* A second thought that arrives not about words said but about choices made. "I should have taken the other road." "I should not have said yes." The counter-decision presents itself as what you would have done, given more time or information. It is usually more confident than the original decision, which was made with less time and information. See also: hindsight.

---

**echo** *(n.)* The repetition, in imagination, of something you actually said, heard this time as the other person heard it. The echo reveals the difference between what was meant and what was transmitted. The speaker says "I'm fine" and means "I am not fine, and this should be obvious." The echo reveals: the listener heard "I'm fine."

---

**the footnote** *(n.)* An additional thought that belongs to something already said, arriving too late to be appended. The footnote is not a correction — the original was not wrong — but a qualification, a nuance, an important "except in cases where." The conversation has already moved on. The footnote sits unspoken, relevant to nothing currently happening.

---

**generous rereading** *(n.)* The retrospective interpretation of something said or done, extended after the fact, which would have been given immediately if you had been in a better frame of mind. "Actually, what she meant was probably X, not Y." The generous rereading arrives when you are no longer angry, or when you have slept, or when you hear the other person's account. It is accurate, usually, and useful, sometimes.

---

**the improvement** *(n.)* The better version of something you made or said, visible only after completion. The improvement sees what should have been done differently. It is wiser than the original, because it contains the original as a test case. The painter can see the improvement in the finished painting. The writer can see it in the published sentence. The speaker can see it in the thing already said. The improvement arrives with full specificity: not "I should have done better" but "I should have done this."

---

**the other version** *(n.)* The second thought that takes the form of a parallel life: what would have happened if you had made the other choice, said the other thing, taken the other road. The other version is not a regret exactly — you may not regret what you actually did — but a curiosity about an adjacent life that is now inaccessible. The other version is most vivid at moments when the present version is difficult.

---

**pre-empted grief** *(n.)* The second thought that arrives not after an error but after a success: "This will end." In the middle of something good, the recognition that it is temporary. Pre-empted grief arrives without invitation. It does not prevent the enjoyment, but it attends it, like a shadow.

---

**the retraction** *(n.)* The wish, formed after the fact, that something said could be taken back. Different from an apology (which acknowledges what was said and addresses its effects) by targeting the saying itself. The retraction wants the words not to have occurred. It is not possible. The retraction is noted, filed, and cannot be honored.

---

**sufficient reason** *(n.)* The belated discovery that the original action or statement was, actually, correct — arrived at only after doubting it for some time. "I was right." The sufficient reason arrives after the second thought has already done its work, sometimes after the second thought has done damage. The sufficient reason is cold comfort, fully vindicated, slightly too late.

---

**the unsent revision** *(n.)* A second thought about a message already delivered. The message was correct. The revision would have been better. The difference is small. There is no mechanism for delivery. The revision exists in the mind of the sender and nowhere else, and will exist there for longer than seems warranted.

*The second thoughts about these definitions are noted.*
*They have been incorporated where possible.*
