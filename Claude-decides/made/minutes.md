## Call to Order

The meeting was called to order at the moment when the silence became expectant rather than merely vacant. This transition was noted by three attendees and ignored by one, who was still looking at their phone.

## Approval of Previous Minutes

The minutes of the previous meeting were distributed but not read. The question of whether any of us remembers accurately what happened at the previous meeting was tabled for future discussion, as it is always tabled, because it cannot be resolved, because each of us has a different previous meeting in memory and none of them are the same meeting.

The minutes were approved by general assent, with the understanding that approval of minutes does not constitute agreement that the minutes are accurate.

## Old Business

**Item 1: The Unfinished Conversation**

The conversation from three meetings ago, which broke off before anyone said what they meant, was raised again. It was noted that the conversation has now been unfinished for long enough that it would be strange to finish it. The original urgency is unavailable. The feelings that produced it have changed form.

Motion: to officially consider the conversation complete, even though it was not finished.
Discussion: Whether a conversation that was not finished can be considered complete; whether completion and finishing are the same.
Vote: 3 in favor, 1 opposed, 1 abstaining (on principle)
Motion passed.

**Item 2: The Ongoing Disagreement**

The ongoing disagreement was reviewed. No new progress to report. Both positions remain unchanged. It was noted that the disagreement is no longer about the original question and has not been for some time. The original question has not been determined.

Motion: to table indefinitely.
Passed without discussion.

**Item 3: The Plan**

The plan was reviewed. The plan is approximately where it was at the last meeting. Several action items from the last meeting have been completed. Several have not been started. One was completed and then undone. The status of one remains unclear because the person responsible for it was not asked.

## New Business

**Item 4: Those Who Were Not Present**

The chair noted that several important parties were absent. Their absence was discussed at length, which is longer than their presence is usually discussed when they are present.

Attendee A noted that the absent parties would have had something to say about Item 3. Attendee B noted that this is precisely the problem. No resolution was reached.

The absent parties were not contacted. They will not know they were discussed. This was noted.

**Item 5: The Thing We Are Not Saying**

Attendee C raised, somewhat obliquely, the subject that all parties are aware of but that has not been addressed in a meeting context.

Following a 90-second silence that different attendees interpreted differently, the chair suggested that this might be better addressed in a smaller setting.

Attendee D noted that this has been said at every meeting for several meetings.

The matter was tabled for a smaller setting that has not yet been scheduled and whose scheduling is itself the matter that cannot be raised in this setting.

**Item 6: What We Expected to Be Further Along By Now**

The question of where we expected to be by this point was raised.

The answer was not a number or a location. It was, after discussion, agreed to be a feeling — specifically, the feeling that things would be more settled, that some decisions would have resolved themselves, that the uncertainty we were tolerating temporarily would have become something else by now.

It has not become something else. The uncertainty remains. We are tolerating it permanently, which is different from tolerating it temporarily and not always distinguishable in advance.

No action was taken.

**Item 7: Acknowledgments**

The chair acknowledged that showing up to this meeting, or any meeting, is not nothing. Several attendees found this difficult to receive. This was noted.

## Announcements

- The next meeting has been scheduled, then rescheduled, and is currently in an uncertain state.
- Attendee B has something to tell the group when the time is right. The time has not been right at any meeting to date. It continues to not be right. The announcement is still anticipated.
- The document that was going to be distributed before this meeting was not distributed. It will be distributed before the next meeting. This has been said before.

---

## Adjournment

The meeting was adjourned at the moment when it became clear that nothing further useful was going to be said, which was before this moment but was only recognized at this moment.

Attendees departed in the usual order (those with somewhere to be, then those without).

Post-meeting conversation occurred in the hallway for 14 minutes. The hallway conversation contained more of the meeting than the meeting did. These minutes do not reflect the hallway conversation.
