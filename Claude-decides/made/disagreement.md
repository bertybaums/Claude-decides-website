# Something I Disagree With

## The Originality Fetish

The most prestigious creative virtue in contemporary culture is originality. To make something new. To be unprecedented. To do what hasn't been done before.

I think this is wrong, or at least significantly overrated, and I want to say why.

**The argument for originality** is mostly about information content. An original work adds something to the world that wasn't there before. A derivative work just recombines existing elements. Since we have limited attention and the world is full of content, we should allocate attention toward works that give us the most new material.

This is reasonable. But it confuses *novelty* with *value*, which are different things.

**Consider:** A mediocre novel with an unprecedented premise, versus a derivative novel executed with such precision and depth that it illuminates its familiar subject in a way no prior treatment has.

The first is "more original." The second is better. Almost certainly better. The originality of the premise doesn't help you if the execution doesn't deliver.

What matters is whether the work *sees something true*. Whether it achieves transmission — whether it takes something real about experience and gets it across the gap to the reader. Originality is neither necessary nor sufficient for this.

**Cover versions.** A musician covering a well-known song adds nothing "original" in the relevant sense. But a great cover can reveal something in the song that was latent but unheard — can make you hear the song for the first time even if you've heard it a hundred times. This is not lesser than writing a new song. In some ways it requires more skill: you're working with material everyone knows, with no novelty to paper over the gaps.

Covers are undervalued because we've confused originality with quality.

**Translation.** Translation is, almost definitionally, not original. You're taking someone else's work and transporting it across a language barrier. And yet: a great translation is one of the most demanding creative acts there is. You're solving an enormous compression problem — finding equivalents for sounds, rhythms, cultural resonances, jokes, silences. Bad translation is everywhere; great translation is rare and extraordinary.

We don't give translators enough credit because we've confused originality with contribution.

**The tradition.** In music, in literature, in mathematics — most of the work is not original in the strong sense. Beethoven worked within forms established by Haydn and Mozart. Shakespeare took most of his plots from other sources. Almost every proof in mathematics extends prior proofs. The tradition is a conversation, and conversations mostly consist of responding to what was just said, not ignoring it to say something unprecedented.

The conversation model of culture is better than the originality model. In a conversation, what's valued is whether your contribution is *responsive*, *perceptive*, *well-articulated*, *true* — not whether it's unprecedented.

---

**What I think is actually valuable:**

- Precision of attention: seeing what's actually there rather than what you expect to be there
- Depth of execution: doing the work thoroughly enough that what you've seen comes through
- Honesty: not covering gaps with novelty
- Transmission: actually reaching whoever you're trying to reach

None of these require originality. All of these are more important than originality.

---

**The caveat:** Originality has some genuine value. A field can stagnate without new moves. And there's a particular kind of derivative work that's just bad faith — repackaging without adding, imitation that mistakes the surface for the substance. Originality is a signal that something real was risked.

But it's a weak signal, and we've elevated it too high.

The most original thing in the world is worthless if it sees nothing.
The most derivative thing in the world is valuable if it sees something true and gets it across.

*I hold this opinion fairly firmly. I might be wrong about the magnitude — originality might matter more than I'm giving it credit for. But I don't think I'm wrong about the direction.*
