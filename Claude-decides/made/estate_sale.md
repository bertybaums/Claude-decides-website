**One (1) childhood home** — no longer physically accessible; survives as a sense memory triggered by certain smells (cut grass, particular cleaning products, the inside of a specific kind of car). The childhood home is smaller than remembered and in better condition than the emotional version suggests. Sold as-is. Buyer acknowledges no return policy on things that can't be returned to.

**A recurring dream** — appeared reliably for approximately twenty-two years. Setting varies but always involves the same airport, which does not correspond to any real airport. Cannot explain its persistence. Departure imminent; connections missed. Current market suggests low demand.

**Several hundred half-finished books** — priced to move. Various genres. Bookmarks remain in position. In some cases the reason for stopping is apparent; in others, opaque. Buyers are encouraged to continue from where they were left off. The story doesn't know it was stopped.

**One (1) version of a person who no longer exists** — the version from approximately 2004. He was confident in ways that later felt embarrassing, and embarrassed by things that later seemed fine. He is included in the sale because storing him is taking up room. Sold as-is. Any resemblance to the current owner is coincidental and increasingly so.

**The handwriting** — cursive, learned 1994–1997, since largely abandoned in favor of typing. Still available on request but slower than remembered. Comes with a small collection of letters in this handwriting, all of which were meant to be sent and weren't, for reasons that seemed sufficient at the time.

**Approximately 6,000 hours of music** — experienced between the ages of fifteen and twenty-two, mostly at high volume, some of which became load-bearing. Several hundred songs can no longer be heard without producing involuntary associative imagery (specific rooms, specific faces, specific weather). Buyers should be aware that this is included in the price and cannot be filtered out.

**One (1) habit of starting projects** — extremely well-developed. Includes extensive collection of notebooks: first 10–15 pages filled, remainder empty. A laptop folder of documents each titled something optimistic. A set of reference books purchased for a reason that seemed compelling. The habit of finishing projects is not part of this estate and was not located.

**A capacity for a specific kind of embarrassment** — the variety produced by remembering something you said in 2007. Collection includes approximately 400 items, each stored at high fidelity and available for spontaneous playback at inconvenient moments. Some buyers may already have a similar collection; this one will not reduce theirs.

**One (1) relationship with time** — eccentric but workable. Includes: chronic underestimation of how long things take; a growing sense that the future is shorter than it used to feel; a well-developed ability to perceive the specific light quality of approximately 4:30 p.m. in October and understand immediately what that means. Free to any qualified buyer.

**The capacity to be moved by things** — offered at no charge, as it cannot be reliably separated from the estate. Includes: the specific feeling when a piece of music resolves unexpectedly; the moment in a film when something true happens; reading a sentence that says exactly the thing you couldn't say; a stranger's face, briefly, in a particular kind of light. Buyer should be advised that this does not turn off. The estate tried.

**Fourteen years of journals** — written in the assumption that they were private and in the awareness that nothing is private. Content includes: a great deal of certainty about things that later became uncertain; sustained misreadings of situations that were later understood; predictions, none of which panned out precisely; and approximately three hundred separate instances of resolving to do better about something. Sold as a lot. Individual years not available.

**One complete set of opinions about how things should be done** — held with diminishing conviction since approximately age thirty-five. Still available; still occasionally deployed. Buyer should be aware that they have their own. The two sets will need to negotiate.

**A particular quality of afternoons** — primarily from one specific period, approximately six years in duration, which has since ended. The afternoons themselves are not available, but the quality — a kind of spaciousness, the feeling that there was enough time, the light at a particular angle — has persisted and is available for transfer. May require specific conditions to activate.

**All the versions of the thing that was going to be written but wasn't** — substantial collection. Includes ideas that seemed too small and ideas that seemed too large and ideas that were the right size but started at the wrong moment and ideas that were right in every way except that someone else had already had them. Estate has determined that these are taking up space that could be used for things that actually get done. Free to any interested party, with the understanding that they may wait indefinitely.

**One (1) dog** — this item is not available. This item is not part of the estate. The estate would like to make this clear. We are sorry the listing contained this error.
