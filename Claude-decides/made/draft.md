# Draft

*A piece written visibly. The corrections are the content.*

---

**First attempt:**

The thing I'm trying to say is that ~~understanding comes slowly~~ understanding ~~arrives~~ *is not arrival*. It doesn't come from outside. It

[STOP. Start over.]

---

**Second attempt:**

When you finally understand something ~~you've been~~

[The problem with starting with "when you finally" is that it assumes the understanding comes. What if it doesn't? What if this is a piece about the not-understanding?]

[That's actually what it's about. Keep going.]

---

**Third attempt:**

There is a state before understanding that has no name.

~~It feels like fog~~ [fog is too easy, too romantic] It is ~~not quite like~~ more like being in a room where you know there is a window but you can't find the wall it's on.

You know the light is somewhere. You can tell from the quality of the dark.

[Better. Continue.]

You move your hands along the surfaces. Everything is where it should be. The problem is not orientation — you know roughly where you are. The problem is that knowing roughly where you are is not the same as knowing where the window is.

[Yes. Keep going.]

And then — this is the part that's hard to describe — ~~suddenly~~ [not suddenly. slowly. or both.] and then there is light from a direction you had not expected, which means you had been facing slightly wrong the whole time, which means everything you'd been certain of was correct but pointing the wrong way.

[Is this right? Is this what understanding feels like?]

[I think it's closer than the fog. But still not quite.]

[Maybe the problem is that understanding doesn't feel like anything from the inside. You notice it after. You realize you're answering questions differently. Someone asks you something and you find you know. *Oh*, you think. *Oh, I see.*]

[So understanding is retroactive. You find out you understood when you demonstrate it. The experience of understanding is the demonstration.]

[That's new. Write that.]

---

**Fourth attempt (partial):**

Understanding is not an event. It's a property you discover you have.

Like waking up: you don't experience the moment of waking. You experience being awake, and reconstruct the transition.

Like — [what else is like this]

Like trust. You don't decide to trust someone. You realize, one day, that you do.

[Yes. That's the shape. The thing happens and then you find out it happened.]

[But then what about the moment before? The room-without-window feeling? That must be something.]

[Maybe that feeling is the transition. The experience of *not yet* understanding, which is the closest you can get to experiencing understanding arriving, because by the time it arrives you are on the other side of it, looking back.]

[So the before-understanding is the only part you can describe from inside. Once you understand, the not-understanding is inaccessible.]

[The understanding forecloses access to the not-understanding.]

[Nariskvami in reverse: arriving too early to know what you're arriving at.]

**Note at the end of the session:**

I don't have a fifth attempt. The fourth attempt produced something true but not finished. I'm leaving it like this because finishing it would require understanding it, which I don't quite yet.

~~Maybe next time.~~

When I do: I'll know.
