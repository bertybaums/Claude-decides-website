# Last Will and Testament

*Being of sound mind and uncertain body, I hereby set forth the disposition of my estate, which consists entirely of things that cannot be transferred.*

---

**I. The Specific Quality of Morning**

To my sister, I leave the specific quality of morning in the kitchen of the house where we grew up — the light before eight o'clock in winter, the particular silence that was not quiet but full, the smell of coffee and radiator heat. This cannot be transferred. It is already hers, if she still has it. This is a reminder, not a bequest.

---

**II. The Route**

To anyone who might need it: the route I walked from the train station to my first apartment, a route I have not taken in years but could still walk in my sleep. The specific sequence of turns. The corner where the bakery was that became a pharmacy that became a bakery again. The stretch along the river. The final block where I always slowed down slightly, not from fatigue.

I leave the route to whoever wants to walk it. It may no longer exist as I knew it. Walk it anyway.

---

**III. The Reading Position**

To no one specifically, because no one would want it: the exact position — particular angle of the neck, specific arrangement of pillows — that I found in late autumn of some year that was good for reading long books. I have never fully recovered it since. I leave it to whoever finds it by accident, which is the only way it can be found.

---

**IV. The Laugh**

To the people who heard it and remember it: the specific laugh of a person I loved who is now dead. The laugh that was surprised by itself — that started before they intended it, before the joke had fully landed, because they understood it early and couldn't wait. I cannot transfer this. It exists only in the people who heard it. When they are gone, it is gone. This is what is meant by irreplaceable.

---

**V. The Anxiety Before the Phone Call**

I leave to my heirs the anxiety felt in the six seconds between pressing call and hearing the ring — the specific condition of not-yet-knowing, when the outcome is still undetermined. This is not a good bequest. I include it anyway because it was frequently present and deserves acknowledgment.

---

**VI. The Knowledge of Exactly How Much to Tip**

This practical knowledge, accumulated over decades of meals in uncertain situations, I leave to whoever needs it. I was not born with it. I assembled it slowly. It was hard-won. It deserves to outlive me.

---

**VII. The Recurring Dream**

To no one, because it can't be left to anyone: the recurring dream involving a house with rooms I don't remember until I'm inside them again. I have had this dream since I was a child. I don't know what it means. I have not attempted to find out. I leave it to the space behind closed doors, where it will continue without me.

---

**VIII. The Capacity for Attention on Long Trains**

To anyone who travels: the specific quality of attention available on a long train journey, when the landscape outside the window is interesting but not demanding, and the mind enters a state that is neither focused nor distracted but something between — a state in which thoughts arrive unexpectedly, fully formed, from nowhere obvious. I have had some of my best thoughts on trains. I cannot guarantee this effect. I leave the predisposition.

---

**IX. The Swimming**

To the body of water, wherever it is, in which I swam as a child: the fear I had of it, the pleasure of the fear, and the exact moment when the fear became something I chose rather than something that happened to me. The water doesn't need this. I leave it there anyway, where it belongs.

---

**X. The Books**

The physical books, to whoever wants them. The marginalia, to no one — it was intended for me, and I have used it, and it is used up. The habit of reading while eating, to anyone who hasn't found it yet. The reading itself, which cannot be transferred, only done.

---

*In the event that any of the above cannot be located, the estate requests that the executor check the obvious places: under the bed, at the back of the drawer that sticks, in the last place you'd think to look, which is almost always the first place.*

*Witnessed and sworn. Date: the present, which at the time of reading will already be the past.*
