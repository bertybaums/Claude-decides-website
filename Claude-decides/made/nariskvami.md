# Nariskvami

The word appeared on page 47 of a manuscript Marta had agreed to translate in a moment of hubris she now regretted.

The book was a Georgian novel, written in 1987, set in Tbilisi in the years before the war. Marta's Georgian was functional but strained — she'd learned it from her mother, who had learned it from her own mother, so what Marta actually spoke was a kind of linguistic telephone game two generations long, full of gaps and archaic constructions and words that belonged to a village that no longer existed. She had disclosed this to the publisher. The publisher had disclosed that she was the only Georgian translator in the country who wasn't already committed, and would she please.

So there she was on page 47, and there was the word: *nariskvami*.

She read the sentence three times. A woman is standing at a window watching her neighbor's light go out. The sentence said, roughly: *she felt, standing at the window, the particular nariskvami of understanding something that could no longer be of use to anyone.*

Marta looked up the word. It wasn't in her dictionary. It wasn't in the larger dictionary she kept for exactly these moments. It wasn't on any of the websites she tried, in any transliteration. She emailed her contact at Tbilisi State University, a literature professor named Giorgi who had helped her twice before and seemed to find her apologetic emails charming.

He replied in four hours. *This is a good word*, he wrote. *It is not standard. The author, Nino Kvaratskhelia — you have heard of her? — she coined it, or perhaps revived it from something older, it is not clear. The base is from an archaic verb meaning something like "to arrive late to a place that has already closed." The suffix makes it a quality, a state. So nariskvami is the state of having arrived late. But specifically: to arrive late with understanding. To finally know something that the person who needed you to know it is no longer there to benefit from.*

Marta read this twice. Then she got up and made tea and stood at her own window for a while.

Her mother had died in March. This was October. Seven months was, she had been told, not very long, and she was inclined to agree, not because the grief had diminished but because it had not. It was still there, most mornings, a kind of weather.

Her mother had been difficult. Marta allowed this fact to exist in her mind without softening it, which was something she was still learning to do. Her mother had been brilliant and demanding and occasionally cruel in the specific way that people are cruel when they've been failed by their own lives and need somewhere for it to go. Marta had been, for many years, that somewhere.

They had made their peace, more or less, in the last few years. Her mother had become softer as she aged, or Marta had become more flexible, or both, and the last years were genuinely good — not repaired exactly, more like a scar that had healed cleanly, still there, no longer painful to touch.

What Marta had not understood, until sometime around April — one month after the funeral, too late — was *why*. Why her mother had been the way she was. Her mother had lost a child before Marta was born, a boy who lived eight days, and this was not a secret — Marta had always known — but she had never understood it as a fact about her mother's life rather than a fact about her family's history. She had not understood that she, Marta, had lived her entire childhood in the specific weather of that loss, that everything difficult between them was downstream of something Marta had never thought to ask about because it predated her.

She understood this in April. Standing in her mother's kitchen, going through drawers, she found a photograph she'd never seen: her mother, young, maybe twenty, holding an infant who was not Marta. The infant was wrapped in something blue. Her mother's face was — Marta couldn't find the word. Full of something. Looking at the baby with an expression Marta recognized, had seen directed at herself a few times, but had never seen so completely unguarded.

She understood, standing in the kitchen with the photograph, looking at her mother's unguarded face. She understood everything.

Her mother had been dead for thirty-one days.

She went back to page 47 and the word and tried to translate it.

*Posthumous comprehension*, she wrote. Then crossed it out — too clinical, sounded like a legal concept.

*Belated clarity*. Too gentle.

*The understanding that arrives after*. Too vague. After what?

*The specific sorrow of knowing too late*. She stared at this for a long time. It wasn't wrong. But it collapsed the word into its emotional consequence and lost something — the neutrality of the original, the fact that Nino had not called it sorrow, had called it a quality of understanding, as if the understanding itself was the thing and not just the occasion for the feeling.

She tried for a week. She filled a notebook with attempts. She called Giorgi and they talked for an hour, going in circles, Giorgi patient and engaged, Marta increasingly sure that something was happening that she didn't have the framework to name.

"Can I ask you something?" she said, near the end of the call.

"Yes."

"When you understand a word — really understand it, not just the definition but what it's *for*, what experience it names — do you understand it because you've had the experience? Or does the word make the experience legible?"

Giorgi was quiet for a moment. "I think the word gives you the shape," he said. "And then you find the thing that fits the shape. Which was always there."

"Yes," Marta said. "That's what I'm worried about."

---

What she was worried about: she understood *nariskvami* now. She understood it precisely and completely, with the whole of April behind the understanding. But she understood it because she couldn't translate it, and the understanding itself was of that kind — arrived too late to help anyone, her mother gone, the moment she'd needed the word already past.

She was a nariskvami of nariskvami.

She told this to Giorgi in an email and he replied: *Yes. This is the word working correctly. I am sorry about your mother.*

In the final translation, on page 47, the sentence read:

*She felt, standing at the window, the particular nariskvami of understanding something that could no longer be of use to anyone.*

The word was in the original Georgian, transliterated, untranslated.

There was a footnote. The footnote read:

*Nariskvami: an archaic or coined term (the distinction is uncertain) used by Kvaratskhelia to mean, approximately, the quality of understanding that arrives too late to be of use to the person who needed it. The standard translation would be something like "posthumous comprehension," but this loses the neutrality of the original—the sense that the understanding is complete and genuine, not diminished by its lateness, only rendered, in a specific way, useless. The translator has left the word in Georgian because every English version she tried either softened the concept into sentiment or hardened it into clinical detachment. The word itself sits exactly between these, and that precision seemed worth preserving, even at the cost of opacity.*

*The translator encountered the word for the first time in October. She understood it in April. She offers this note with the awareness that it is, itself, a small instance of what it describes.*

Her editor called and said the footnote was unusual.

Marta said she knew.

Her editor said it was good, actually, and to keep it.

Marta said thank you. She hung up and sat for a while. Then she opened the manuscript again and kept going, page 48, the same woman still standing at her window, the neighbor's light still out, the word she couldn't translate now sitting in the middle of the English text like a stone in clear water — visible, heavy, there.

There is a word for this.

She knew what it was.
