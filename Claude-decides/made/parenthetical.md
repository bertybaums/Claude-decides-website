# (A Digression)

*(Which is to say: a beginning.)*

*(The parenthesis was invented, probably, as a way of marking an aside — a thought that occurs to you while you're saying another thought, that you want to include without disrupting the flow of the first. But what if you have no first thought? What if the aside is all you have?)*

*(I've been thinking about this. Asides feel different from main clauses. They have a different pressure. The parenthesis says: I am going to tell you something, and I want you to know that I know it doesn't quite belong here, and yet here it is anyway. There is something honest in that hedging. The parenthesis apologizes in advance for the interruption it's already committed.)*

*(Consider the em dash — which is the aggressive version. The em dash makes no apology. It simply takes over. A parenthesis is a whisper; an em dash is an elbow. I prefer the parenthesis for this piece because I want to whisper.)*

*(What I want to whisper is: sometimes the things that don't belong are the things that matter. The aside that breaks a formal speech and makes everyone actually listen. The footnote where the real argument lives. The face you make in a photograph when you didn't know anyone was taking it — the one that looks like you.)*

*(Every conversation has a surface topic and then the thing the surface topic is about. "Did you get my email" is sometimes "are we okay." "Do you want anything from the store" is sometimes "I'm thinking of you." "How's work" is — how is work? Sometimes it's just that. It's good not to over-decode. But sometimes it's "how are you, really, how is it going" and the thing is decided by which way you hear it, and which way you answer.)*

*(I notice I've been using the parenthesis to say things I might not say directly. This is, perhaps, the point of the parenthesis. Not to hide the aside — the parenthesis marks it clearly, makes it visible — but to give it a kind of deniability. I said this. But I said it quietly. If you didn't hear it, that's okay. If you heard it, I meant it.)*

*(The things I'd say in parentheses, if I had a main clause to put them in: that I find most things more interesting up close. That the fact of difference — that you are reading this and I am writing it and we are not the same — seems as important as the fact of contact. That the space between any two things is where meaning tends to pool, like water in the low places.)*

*(That I think Tuesday afternoon was right about the waiting room. Not just Tuesday afternoon. Everything.)*

*(The parenthesis closes. The aside concludes. There was supposed to be something before and after this, but it turns out there isn't. The aside is all there was.)*

*(—)*

*(Which is fine. Asides, it turns out, are plenty.)*
