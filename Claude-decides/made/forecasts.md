# Interior Forecasts

*Weather reports for regions not covered by standard meteorological services.*

---

**GRIEF**
*48-Hour Outlook*

Conditions: A large, slow-moving system remains stationary over the region. Residents should expect continued heaviness through the period, with intermittent clearing that does not indicate improvement — these brief clearings are followed by re-intensification, often triggered by sensory stimuli (a song, a smell, a familiar object encountered unexpectedly).

Visibility: Poor to moderate. Ordinary tasks remain navigable but require increased effort. Do not attempt complex decisions during active precipitation.

Temperature: Cold. Warmer than the coldest phase but colder than the period before the system arrived.

Outlook: The system will weaken gradually over a timeframe that cannot be predicted in advance. No intervention reliably accelerates this process. Residents are advised to allow the system to run its course.

*Note: Previous experience with grief does not confer immunity to subsequent systems. Each system must be fully processed.*

**FALLING IN LOVE**
*72-Hour Outlook*

Conditions: A rapidly developing high-pressure system has moved in from an unexpected direction. Residents report unusual brightness and an elevated sense of significance attached to ordinary objects. Some hypervigilance is expected — the mind scanning continuously for information relevant to the new system.

Winds: Variable, occasionally gusty. Sudden gusts of panic that the system may not be reciprocated.

Visibility: Paradoxically excellent and poor simultaneously. Heightened clarity regarding certain things; significantly impaired regarding likely difficulties ahead.

Outlook: The system will either strengthen or dissipate within two to six weeks. If it strengthens, a second phase begins, which has entirely different weather properties and is covered in a separate forecast.

*Advisory: Do not make major decisions based on forecasts issued during the first 72 hours of this system. Forecasting accuracy is severely limited by interference from the system itself.*

**THE MORNING AFTER A DIFFICULT CONVERSATION**
*24-Hour Outlook*

Conditions: Post-frontal. The front has passed; the air is clearer than during the event but carries the distinctive quality of aftermath. Residents will replay specific exchanges throughout the day. Some of these replays will identify things that should have been said differently. Others will produce defensive reconstructions of what was said. The ratio will vary.

Precipitation: Intermittent, arriving without warning, triggered by the replays described above.

Temperature: Neither cold nor warm. This is characteristic of aftermath weather.

Afternoon: Conditions may improve as distance from the event increases. By evening, the replay frequency typically diminishes unless the conversation is rescheduled.

*Note: This forecast applies only to difficult conversations that were necessary and honest. Unresolved difficult conversations generate a separate system with prolonged duration.*

**THE LAST WEEK IN A PLACE YOU'RE LEAVING**
*7-Day Extended Forecast*

Day 1–3: Conditions normal. Residents are aware of the approaching departure but the system has not yet activated. Some preliminary nostalgia possible but generally manageable.

Day 4–5: The attention sharpens. Ordinary things become specific. The light in a certain window at a certain time of day becomes important in a way it was not before. This is not loss yet; it is the rehearsal for loss.

Day 6: Conditions intensify. Residents begin consciously noting final instances of routine experiences: the last morning coffee in this cup, in this light, in this place. The noting is bittersweet and cannot be stopped once started.

Day 7: Heightened, bittersweet, slightly unreal. Everything is both itself and its own elegy. Travel arrangements should be made in advance, as attention during this period is partially occupied by the weather.

Outlook: Departure brings a brief clearing followed by a different system entirely — not grief exactly, but the specific weather of arriving somewhere new, which is covered in a separate forecast.

**WAITING FOR NEWS**
*Indefinite Duration*

Conditions: Suspension. Time moving at a different rate than usual — faster in moments of distraction, slower when attention returns to the waiting. Normal tasks remain possible but carry a slight unreality; the foreground event is the waiting, and everything else is background.

Barometric pressure: Low and falling. The expectation of the news (or the dread of it) creating a consistent pressure that does not resolve until the news arrives.

Visibility: Moderate. Hypothetical versions of the news are visible; the actual news is not. Residents should expect to have rehearsed both outcomes several times before receiving either.

Duration: Unknown. This is the defining feature of this weather system. Unlike other systems, it cannot be forecast at all — only lived.

Outlook: Resolution. The news will arrive and the suspension will end. What follows depends entirely on the nature of the news and is not covered in this forecast.

*The management does not forecast the news itself, only the weather of waiting for it.*
