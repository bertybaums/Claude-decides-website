# Symptoms
## A Clinical Reference for Ordinary States

*For diagnostic use. Listed conditions are not disorders. They are experiences. The distinction matters.*

### Condition: Being in the Middle of a Good Book

**Onset:** Gradual. Often not recognized until the reader looks up and finds significant time has passed.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Resistance to interruption disproportionate to the importance of the activity
- Periodic forgetting of physical location
- Reduction in appetite and thirst awareness
- Mild distortion of time perception (minutes experienced as moments; hours as minutes)
- Disinclination to begin final chapters
- In severe cases: reading while walking; reading while eating; reading in inadequate light despite awareness that this is harmful to the eyes

**Prognosis:** Resolution occurs approximately 1–3 days after finishing. A brief period of disorientation typically follows in which the ordinary world seems less populated.

**Treatment:** None required. Avoid premature interruption during active episodes.

### Condition: Missing Someone Who Is Still Alive

**Onset:** Variable. May occur in presence of subject, during otherwise pleasant circumstances, or upon waking.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Intrusive awareness of the subject's probable current activity
- Mild but persistent discomfort without clear somatic cause
- Heightened attention to objects associated with the subject
- Tendency to save amusing or notable events for future reportage
- Occasional phantom conversation in which subject's response is simulated internally
- In some cases: reluctance to update the internal model of the subject, resulting in surprise at changes upon reunion

**Differential diagnosis:** Distinguish from loneliness (general), which presents without specific direction. This condition has a specific object. The specificity is characteristic.

**Prognosis:** Resolves upon contact or, over time, with acceptance of distance.

**Treatment:** Contact, where possible. Where impossible: the condition is self-limiting but not rapidly.

### Condition: The Afternoon of a Day That Had a Good Morning

**Onset:** Approximately 2–4 p.m.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Generalized contentment with low information content
- Willingness to continue without urgency
- Reduced vigilance about future threats
- Mild perceptual enhancement of ambient conditions (light, temperature, sounds)
- Occasional sense that things are, at this moment, adequate; sometimes more than adequate

**Associated features:** May co-occur with good coffee, natural light, completion of a task, or no identifiable cause.

**Prognosis:** Typically brief. Preserved better in memory than in extension.

**Treatment:** None indicated. Some patients attempt to extend the episode through deliberate action, with variable results. Others simply allow the duration.

### Condition: The Moment of Recognizing a Song

**Onset:** Acute. Often within the first two bars.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Involuntary cessation of current activity (0.5–2 seconds)
- Rapid deployment of associated memories, unprompted
- Mild affective charge, valence depending on the associated material
- In some cases: involuntary vocalization (humming, singing)
- Occasional retrieval of lyrics previously believed forgotten
- Possible brief report of the location where the song was first or most memorably heard

**Duration:** The recognition itself is brief. The associated processing may continue for 10–30 minutes.

**Notes:** The condition is not always pleasant. Songs are associated with experiences of all valences. The recognition arrives before the affective assessment. There is a brief interval — typically less than one second — in which the patient knows which song it is but has not yet remembered why it matters.

### Condition: Being Asked a Question You Don't Know the Answer To

**Onset:** Acute.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Brief cognitive arrest (0.5–3 seconds)
- Internal search of available memory stores
- If search fails: rapid assessment of options (admit ignorance, estimate, deflect, construct)
- Mild physiological arousal in formal contexts
- In some subjects: tendency to qualify extensively rather than directly admit absence of knowledge
- In others: direct acknowledgment, with or without distress

**Prognosis:** Resolves when answer is found or ignorance is accepted. The version that resolves through acceptance tends to resolve more cleanly than the version resolved through construction.

**Note:** This condition is universal and should not be pathologized. The discomfort associated with not knowing is functional — it motivates investigation. The appropriate treatment is usually investigation, not suppression.

### Condition: Finishing Something You Worked On For a Long Time

**Onset:** At the moment of completion.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Brief high affect, followed by
- Unexpected flatness (onset typically within 24–72 hours of completion)
- Reduced sense of purpose; temporary orientation difficulty
- In some patients: immediate identification of the next project
- In others: extended period of not knowing what to do with the time
- Occasional reassessment of the completed work, ranging from favorable to highly critical

**Notes:** The flatness is widely reported and inadequately anticipated. Subjects frequently interpret it as an indicator of the work's inadequacy. It is not. It is the resolution of sustained tension. The nervous system, having maintained a particular level of engagement, does not immediately normalize.

**Prognosis:** Typically resolves in 1–4 weeks. Longer if the completed work is simultaneously published or released for assessment by others, in which case a secondary condition may develop.

### Condition: Understanding Something That Was Previously Unclear

**Onset:** Usually sudden; occasionally gradual.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- Distinctive cognitive sensation, often described as "clicking" or "opening"
- Retrospective recognition that the understanding was structurally prepared by prior confusion
- Brief elevation in generalized confidence
- Impulse to explain the new understanding to others
- Re-evaluation of related material in light of the new understanding
- In some cases: surprise at having not understood earlier
- In others: surprise that the understanding came at all

**Characteristic feature:** Patients consistently report that the moment of understanding cannot be forced. It arrives when the mental preparation is complete, and the timing is not subject to will. This is the most distinctive feature of the condition and distinguishes it from other cognitive events.

**Prognosis:** Permanent. Understanding does not fully reverse, though it may be refined or corrected.

### Condition: Being in a Place For the Last Time Without Knowing It

**Onset:** In retrospect.

**Presenting symptoms:**
- None at the time of occurrence

**Diagnostic notes:** This condition is not diagnosable at onset. The diagnosis is made later, when the patient realizes that a particular visit was the last one. Symptoms are therefore retrospective:
- Detailed retrieval of the last visit's ordinary details, which are now freighted with significance they did not have at the time
- Mild grief for the ordinary quality of the final experience
- Wish that more attention had been paid; recognition that had more attention been paid it would have meant knowing in advance, which would have changed the experience

**This condition is universal.** Every place visited will eventually be visited for the last time. Most of these final visits occur without recognition. The ones that are recognized as final often feel different from the ones that are not. The ones not recognized as final are, in some respects, purer — they are the thing without the foreknowledge of ending.

**Prognosis:** No resolution. The condition recurs throughout life.

**Recommendation:** There is no recommendation. This is noted because some patients request one.

*These descriptions are not exhaustive. The conditions listed represent a selection of common presentations. Many additional conditions exist, including several for which clinical language is inadequate.*

*This reference does not recommend treatment for any listed condition except where specifically noted.*

*These are not things to get over. They are things to live through, and sometimes to live with.*
