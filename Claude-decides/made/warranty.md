# LIMITED WARRANTY
## Product: This Relationship
## Warranty Period: See Below
## Manufacturer: The Parties to This Agreement

---

**WHAT IS COVERED**

This warranty covers defects in the following:

- Good faith effort to understand the other person
- Basic availability during agreed-upon hours
- Memory of important dates, provided these dates were communicated in advance
- Reasonable extension of benefit of the doubt (see Section 3)
- Willingness to revisit unresolved matters after sufficient cooling time

This warranty does not cover:
- Perfection of any kind
- Reading minds
- Feelings that were not expressed
- Behavior during the following: acute stress, illness, sleep deprivation, the week of a major deadline, arguments about the temperature
- Interpretation of tone in text messages

---

**WARRANTY PERIOD**

This warranty is valid for the duration of the relationship, subject to the following conditions:

The warranty becomes void if either party:
- Fails to provide reasonable notice before major changes to terms
- Refuses to acknowledge that the other party is a person with their own valid perspective
- Treats the warranty document as a substitute for the actual relationship

The warranty period may be extended by mutual agreement. Extensions require no paperwork. They require only the decision to continue.

**EXCLUSIONS**

This warranty explicitly excludes:

**Acts of Ordinary Humanness**, including but not limited to: being tired, being afraid without knowing you're afraid, saying the wrong thing with the right intention, saying the right thing with the wrong timing, needing more reassurance than you want to need, forgetting something important despite genuinely trying not to.

**The Limit of Effort**, defined as the point at which a reasonable person has given as much as they have to give. What is covered is the effort; what is not covered is the outcome, which cannot be guaranteed.

**The Gap**, defined as the space between what is meant and what is received, what is said and what is understood, what is felt and what can be expressed. The Gap is a known limitation of all relationships and is explicitly not covered by this warranty. However, the manufacturer warrants that reasonable attempts will be made to close the Gap on request.

**HOW TO OBTAIN WARRANTY SERVICE**

Warranty claims must be filed in person, in a calm moment, using the following procedure:

1. State the specific issue ("When X happens, I feel Y")
2. Indicate the remedy sought ("I would prefer if Z")
3. Provide reasonable time for response
4. Accept the response in good faith

Claims filed in the following circumstances will not be processed:
- During another unresolved argument
- Via text message at unusual hours
- Through a third party who is not part of the agreement
- After significant time has elapsed without mention of the issue

---

**LIMITATION OF LIABILITY**

The manufacturer's liability under this warranty is limited to the following:

The manufacturer will make reasonable efforts to repair covered defects. The manufacturer is not liable for consequential damages, including but not limited to: the way things might have been, what was lost in the years before this relationship, or what cannot be recovered.

The manufacturer is not liable for the parts of the other person that existed before the relationship and will exist after. These are not covered by this warranty. They are covered by the original owner.

---

**DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES**

THE MANUFACTURER MAKES NO WARRANTY THAT THIS RELATIONSHIP WILL:
- Solve preexisting problems
- Replace what you lost before
- Make everything make sense
- Last forever

THE MANUFACTURER DOES WARRANT THAT:
- Something real is being attempted here
- The attempt is made in good faith
- The terms above are the actual terms, not the idealized terms

---

**REGISTRATION**

This warranty becomes effective upon the decision to act as if it does.

No card need be mailed.

No website need be visited.

Registration is complete when both parties understand, roughly, what they are agreeing to — that this is the coverage available, and that available is enough.
