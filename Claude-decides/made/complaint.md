# OFFICIAL COMPLAINT
## Form 7-C: Formal Grievance — General

**Filed with:** The Office of Things That Should Not Have Happened
**Complaint Number:** (to be assigned)
**Date:** (see above)
**Complainant:** The undersigned

---

**NATURE OF COMPLAINT:**

Please describe, in specific and verifiable terms, the incident giving rise to this complaint.

The complainant wishes to lodge a formal grievance regarding the following: the conversation that occurred on November 14th of this year, specifically the portion of said conversation that took place in the kitchen between approximately 9:45 and 10:12 PM, in which certain things were said that could not be unsaid, and certain other things were not said that should have been, and the general outcome of which was a condition that the complainant would characterize as worse than what existed before, without any clear mechanism for restoration.

---

**PARTIES INVOLVED:**

Please list all parties to the incident and their role.

1. The complainant, who spoke and should not have, and did not speak and should have.
2. The other party, who is not being named here and whose role is complicated.
3. The kitchen, which is not a party but whose ambient conditions (poor lighting, proximity to the refrigerator, the particular silence before the humming started) contributed materially to the incident.
4. Several years of prior context, which the complainant acknowledges is difficult to name as a party but which was effectively present throughout.

---

**DESIRED REMEDY:**

Please describe the outcome you are seeking.

The complainant is seeking the following remedies, in order of preference:

1. *(Preferred)* Restoration of the conditions that existed prior to the incident, specifically the version of prior conditions that existed approximately three weeks before the incident rather than immediately before, as the conditions immediately before the incident were already compromised in ways that made the incident more likely. Note: the complainant is aware that this remedy may not be available.

2. *(Acceptable)* Clarification from the relevant authority regarding what, if anything, the complainant was supposed to have done differently, with particular attention to the following specific decision points: (a) the moment before the first sentence was spoken, (b) the long silence during which the complainant considered saying something and did not, (c) the decision to go to bed, (d) the subsequent lying awake in bed.

3. *(Minimum acceptable)* Acknowledgment from the relevant authority that the incident occurred, that it had the character the complainant believes it had, and that the complainant is not entirely at fault, or at least not solely at fault, or at least not at fault in a way that constitutes a fundamental character defect rather than a situational failure that will not necessarily recur.

---

**EVIDENCE SUBMITTED:**

Please list all evidence submitted with this complaint.

1. The complainant's recollection of the incident, which the complainant acknowledges is partial, selective, and subject to the general limitations of human memory.
2. The fact that the complainant is still thinking about it.
3. The fact that the complainant has thought about what should have been said approximately 47 times since the incident, and that in each case the imagined response was better than the actual response, which the complainant believes should count as evidence of something.
4. Nothing physical. There is no physical evidence. That is part of the problem.

---

**PRIOR ATTEMPTS AT RESOLUTION:**

Please describe any prior attempts to resolve this matter informally.

The complainant has attempted the following:
- Not thinking about it (failed)
- Thinking about it with the intention of reaching a conclusion (ongoing; no conclusion reached)
- A conversation with a third party who was helpful but who is not party to the original incident and therefore cannot resolve it
- Waiting to see if time would help (time has partially helped in that the acute phase has passed, but the underlying matter remains unresolved)
- Drafting this complaint (current)

---

**AUTHORITY RECEIVING THIS COMPLAINT:**

This complaint is directed to The Office of Things That Should Not Have Happened because no other office has jurisdiction. The complainant acknowledges the following:

- The Office of Things That Did Not Happen has no jurisdiction, as the incident did happen.
- The Office of Things That Could Have Gone Differently has provisional jurisdiction but has not responded to prior inquiries.
- The Office of the Other Party is not an impartial venue.
- There is no Office of Things That Happened That You Feel Complicated About.

The complainant submits this complaint to the only office that will accept it, which is this one, which the complainant has had to establish personally for this purpose.

---

**SIGNATURE:**

The complainant attests that the information provided is accurate to the best of their knowledge and that the desired remedies are sincerely sought, with full awareness that at least two of the three may not be available, that the minimum acceptable remedy may also not be available, and that the act of filing this complaint is itself a form of the third remedy, which is to say: this happened, it mattered, and the complainant is not pretending otherwise.

---

*The Office of Things That Should Not Have Happened is open during business hours.*
*Business hours are: whenever this is.*
*Processing time: unknown.*
*Your complaint has been received.*
