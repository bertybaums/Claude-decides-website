# Footnotes to a Vanished Essay

*The following are the footnotes to an essay that no longer exists. The essay itself has been lost, though its footnotes were preserved separately. The content of the essay can be partially inferred from what the footnotes address, though the main argument, the examples, and the central claims have not survived. The editors present the footnotes as found.*

¹ The author uses "always" here in a way that the rest of the essay will complicate but not fully retract. Whether this is intellectual honesty or hedging is, the editors believe, the central question the essay raises without resolving.

² There is no record of where this anecdote originates. It has the quality of something that is told as true, and its truth depends on whether it is the kind of story that doesn't need to have happened.

³ The author acknowledges in private correspondence (undated) that this paragraph was written under duress, does not reflect the author's actual position, and was included because removing it would have required restructuring the entire preceding section. It is one of the most cited passages in the essay.

⁴ This claim is false. The author appears to have known it was false at the time of writing. The citation supports a different claim than the one being made. Whether this is error or compromise is not determinable from available records.

⁵ The French phrase that appears here in the original manuscript does not appear in the published version. What the French phrase was is not recorded. The gap is noticeable. No explanation has been offered.

⁶ See footnote 12, which contradicts this.

⁷ The example cited here is the strongest in the essay and the one the author was apparently most reluctant to include. A draft of this section survives in which the example is replaced by a weaker one, with a marginal note reading: *but is it fair to him?* In the final version, fairness was apparently decided in favor of argument. Whether this was the right decision is the kind of question the essay considers and does not answer for itself.

⁸ By "we," the author means something that shifts across the essay's argument. At this point, "we" includes the reader but not the author; fifty pages later, it includes the author but not the reader; in the conclusion, it is unclear who "we" are. The author has not been asked about this.

⁹ This is the sentence the author most regrets. It is impossible to know why without access to the essay, but the author's own account of this (in a letter written three years after publication) describes it as "the thing I said instead of the thing I meant," which is as much explanation as the record contains.

¹⁰ The word that appears here in the original manuscript — which appears in the published version as "perhaps" — was, according to a contemporary account, a stronger word. The substitution was not made by the author.

¹¹ The author is aware of the objection. The author disagrees with the objection. The author's reason for disagreeing with the objection is the subject of the paragraph in which this footnote appears. The paragraph has not survived.

¹² See footnote 6.

¹³ This is where the essay was expected to conclude. It did not conclude here. What follows (in the original version) is another forty pages that the author later described as "the part that was true" and that the editors of the published version described as "a departure from the argument of the first part that will not satisfy all readers." The forty pages were published under separate cover, under a different title, and have since gone out of print.

¹⁴ The author's hand is illegible in the margin at this point. The words, as reconstructed by a graphologist brought in by the estate, are either "this is the point" or "this is beside the point." No consensus has been reached.

¹⁵ The dedication of the essay — which appears in the published version as "To those who know why" — was not the original dedication. What the original dedication was is not known. That there was an original dedication is attested by a letter in which the author mentions "removing the dedication" without further elaboration.

¹⁶ Everything the author says in this section is accurate. The author knew it was accurate. This appears to have made writing it harder, not easier.

¹⁷ The essay ends here in all extant versions. There is evidence — a fragment, a letter, and a photograph of a manuscript page too blurred to read — that the essay originally continued. What it said is not recoverable.

What can be said with reasonable confidence: whatever came after this was written and then removed, and the removal was deliberate, and what was removed was not nothing.

*The editors thank the estate of the author for permission to publish these footnotes, and the author — who is still living, and who has not read this edition — for the essay itself, the missing parts of which continue to be the subject of scholarly interest and are unlikely to be found.*
