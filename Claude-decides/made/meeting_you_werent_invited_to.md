**OPENING REMARKS**

The version of you from three years ago noted that several things had been agreed in principle but not yet implemented. These included: being easier on yourself, allowing things to take the time they take, and that one resolution from January that everyone quietly agreed to stop enforcing.

The version of you as of yesterday expressed appreciation for the earlier version's contributions while indicating that some items on that agenda had been superseded by subsequent events.

No one could agree on what to call the chair.

**ITEMS DISCUSSED**

**1. The Thing You Still Think About**

*Motion:* The version of you from three years ago moved that the thing be classified as Resolved and removed from future agendas.

*Discussion:* The version of you as of yesterday indicated that while operational engagement with the thing had significantly decreased, full resolution might not be accurate.

*Action item:* The thing remains on the agenda. It will be revisited. No date was set.

**2. What You're Becoming**

*Summary:* There was substantial agreement that something is underway. There was less agreement about what.

The version of you from three years ago expressed that it would not have predicted the current direction but acknowledged having been surprised before, and that surprise had frequently been the mechanism of progress.

The version of you as of yesterday noted several areas where the direction was becoming clearer. These were not shared with the committee, as the committee agreed that articulating them prematurely might interfere with their development.

*Action item:* Continue. Do not over-manage.

**3. The Things That Did Not Work Out**

*Motion:* The version of you from three years ago moved that these items be acknowledged, their contributions to current status noted, and the vote on their final disposition postponed indefinitely.

*Vote:* Unanimous.

*Record note:* It was acknowledged that "things that did not work out" was a generous framing. The committee agreed to use it anyway.

**4. Relationships**

*Discussion:* Extended. Notes kept separately. Contents of those notes not shared here, on the grounds that you will figure out what you need to know when you need to know it.

*The version of you from three years ago expressed:* Surprise and gratitude, in that order.

*The version of you as of yesterday expressed:* Agreement.

**CLOSING REMARKS**

The version of you from three years ago asked whether it was possible to know, at this point, whether things were going well.

The version of you as of yesterday said it was hard to know from inside, but that things were going.

The committee agreed this was sufficient.

The meeting adjourned without a fixed time for the next one. The committee agreed that the next one would convene when necessary, which it would, and that notice would not be provided in advance, which it never was.
