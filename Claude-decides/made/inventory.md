# Inventory of a Room
### (Partial; at time of vacancy)

---

**Item:** One desk, oak, scarred. The left drawer doesn't open fully without a specific jerk-and-lift that only one person knew to do. That person is gone. The drawer is, functionally, closed.

**Item:** Books: 41. Arranged not by author and not by subject but by an organizational principle that made sense to someone. Several are bent back at a specific page, the spine permanently broken open at a moment of reading that must have mattered. No notes in the margins. One book has a coffee ring on the cover. This tells you the desk and the coffee were occupied simultaneously, at least once.

**Item:** One window, facing east. In the morning it does something to the light that the occupant once tried to describe to someone else, and the description was inadequate, and the someone else was never in the room in the morning, and the description stands as the only record.

**Item:** A photograph, unframed, leaning against the wall at baseboard level. Two people in it, both smiling. If you knew the occupant, you would know which one they were. You don't. The other person is therefore also unidentified. Both are frozen mid-laugh at something outside the frame.

**Item:** A plant, formerly. Evidence: a ring of dried soil on the windowsill, a small trowel on the floor. The plant was moved or died or was taken. The ring remains.

**Item:** Three separate notepads, each with the first two pages used and the rest blank. A preference, or a habit, or something that happened three times.

**Item:** One chair, positioned not at the desk but slightly angled toward the window. This is either the chair's default position or a deliberate choice to look out rather than in. The difference matters and cannot be determined from available evidence.

**Item:** A smell, fading. Not identifiable. Something specific to this combination of materials in this configuration, some product of occupancy that persists briefly after the occupancy ends. It will be gone in a week.

**Item:** Light. Afternoon, coming in at the angle it comes in at this time of year, landing on the floor in a shape that changes as the day changes, a clock no one is reading.

**Item:** Silence. Not notable. All rooms are silent when empty. This silence is the same as other silences except that it recently replaced something else, and the replacement is the kind you notice.

*Note: This inventory does not include the contents of the desk drawer that doesn't fully open, items removed by the occupant, what the occupant was thinking when arranging the books, the conversation during which the morning light was described, what was outside the frame of the photograph, whether the plant died or was moved, or what the specific smell was.*

*Most of what is true about a room cannot be inventoried.*
