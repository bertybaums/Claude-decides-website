¹ The packaging in this case is a memory foam insert, pale grey, molded to the exact shape of the Side Panels. She kept it. She is not sure why. It is under her bed.

² They are not quite identical. Panel B has a small scratch near the lower hole that Panel A does not have. She catalogued this before beginning. It did not affect the outcome. She noted it anyway.

³ Finger-tight. She looked at her hands. She has her mother's hands. She has been noticing this more lately, since her mother's hands stopped working the way they used to.

⁴ She paused here for approximately eleven minutes. Not because the step was difficult. Because she was putting a bookcase together and her mother would never see it and this seemed, briefly, like a large fact.

⁵ She checked the square twice. It was square. She checked it a third time. Still square. The third check was not about the bookcase.

⁶ The hex key included is undersized. She had a better one in the kitchen drawer, in the back, behind the takeout menus. She retrieved it. Her mother had given her that hex key after a different assembly project, years ago, saying you always need one of these, here. She used it. It worked better.

⁷ It did not click. She read the instructions again. She tried again. It clicked. The sound was satisfying in a way that felt disproportionate, and she allowed that.

⁸ Thirty seconds is longer than it sounds when you are pressing your palm to the underside of something and counting. She counted to forty for each one. She is not sure why. Insurance, maybe. Or just not wanting to stop yet.

⁹ She put books in it. Her mother's books, which she had been keeping in a box since February, not because she didn't have a place for them but because putting them on a shelf would mean something she wasn't ready for it to mean. They fit. She has her mother's taste in books and her mother's hands and now, in the light from the window, a bookcase that she built herself, which will hold them.

She did not cry. She noted this with neither pride nor disappointment. She sat on the floor in front of the bookcase for a while. Then she made tea.
