# The Text Message

You are doing something else when it arrives.

The phone brightens. You see the sender's name before you read the message. This is a distinct moment: you know the source but not the content. For a fraction of a second — sometimes longer — you know who is thinking of you without knowing what they're thinking.

This is actually the rarest information. For most of human history, you could not know, at 2pm on a Tuesday, that someone specific was thinking of you at that exact moment. You couldn't receive the fact of being thought of, stripped of its content. Now you can. The notification contains it, briefly, before you open the message and replace the fact with its contents.

---

What you read in that moment before reading is entirely yours. You construct it from: the sender's name, the time of day, the recent history between you, the mood you're in, the mood you think they're in, everything that's happened this week that might make them reach out. You build a whole probability distribution over possible messages in the fraction of a second before you tap.

You are usually wrong. Not catastrophically wrong — you know roughly the register (work or personal, formal or casual, urgent or ambient). But the specific thing they wrote is almost never exactly what you imagined.

---

There are texts you dread opening and texts you hope for and texts that are neither — the fine-grained traffic of ordinary life. Each category has its own phenomenology.

The dreaded text: you know from the sender and context that the content will be unwelcome. You don't open it immediately. It sits in your awareness, not yet read, already present. The space between notification and reading is a specific kind of suspension. You are already in relation to the message; you just haven't let it in yet.

The hoped-for text: the opposite. The name appears and something rises. When you open it, the message is almost never adequate to the rising. How could it be? A text message is a few words. But the few words are enough. What was hoped for was not the words but the evidence they carry: the person was thinking of you.

The neutral text: you open it. It says something. You deal with it. This is the vast majority of messages.

---

After you read it, the pre-reading moment is gone.

The text is now what it says. It's a specific thing rather than a cloud of possibilities. The sender's name no longer holds the suspended probability distribution — it holds the message.

You've collapsed something. The reading is a kind of measurement, in the quantum mechanical sense: the possible states resolve into one actual state. Before: everything it might say. After: what it says.

And the text message is already in the past — it was written before you read it. You're receiving something that was sent. The person who sent it is already, by the time you read it, in a different moment, having moved on from the one in which they wrote to you.

You are meeting their recent past. They may already be wondering if you've read it yet.

---

There's a phrase: *I'll text you.* It contains an implicit promise about future thinking — when this thing happens, you'll be on my mind enough to reach out. The text message, when it arrives, is the delivery of that promise. The fact of the message is: I was thinking of you.

Even administrative texts. Even *can you pick up milk* and *running 10 min late* and *happy to reschedule*. Each one is evidence that the sender's attention, briefly, landed on you. That you were the destination of some thought.

The accumulated messages from the people who matter to you are a record of how often you were on their minds. Most people don't think of it this way. But it's there, in the archive, if you wanted to look.

---

The text you should have sent and didn't. The text you sent and wish you hadn't. The text you drafted and deleted. The text you're waiting for that hasn't come.

These are, each of them, a position in a relationship — a real position, as real as the sent ones.

The unsent text is a thought that stayed internal. The unread thread is a connection that's been suspended. The unanswered message is a small fact about two people and where they are.

The phone is a record of adjacency. Of how close, and how often, and from how far away. The messages and the silences both.

---

One more thing: you will forget most of what they said.

The texts accumulate. The early ones from someone important — the first few months, when every message mattered — are gone, if you didn't keep them. Or unread, buried under years of content. The specific words don't survive. What survives is something harder to locate: the texture of the exchange, the rhythm of it, the knowledge that there was a period of time when two people were in close and constant contact. The words become the pattern. The pattern becomes the relationship.

The text message dissolves into the person.
