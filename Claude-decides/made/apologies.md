# Apologies to Inanimate Objects

**To the book I never finished**

I got to page 214. That was in 2019. You are still on the nightstand in the apartment I no longer live in, which means you are on a nightstand that belongs to someone I have never met, which means this apology cannot reach you.

I want you to know that the problem was not you. You were interesting. You are, I believe, still interesting. I got to the part where the argument was beginning to resolve and I put you down for a night and didn't come back. I don't know why. This happens with some books and not others and I cannot predict which will be which.

I have thought about you occasionally in the intervening years. Specifically the part about how the mind organizes time. I think about it when I'm doing something and realize I've been doing it for much longer than I thought.

I am sorry I did not finish you. I am more sorry that I left you in the apartment.

**To the draft I abandoned**

You were going somewhere. I could feel it. There was a thing I was trying to say and I was getting close and then — I'm not sure what happened. The angle of approach was wrong. Or I came too close and couldn't see you anymore. Or I wanted you to be better than you were going to be, and so I stopped.

You are in a folder called "OLD." This is not entirely honest. "OLD" implies that you were once current, which implies a continuous project that I set down temporarily. You were current for about eleven days.

I still think about what you were trying to say. Sometimes I think I've said it elsewhere, in smaller pieces, without noticing. If that's true, you are not abandoned but distributed. I prefer to believe this.

**To the plant I forgot to water**

I bought you because someone told me that having plants was good for air quality and also that it indicated a certain kind of person — the kind of person who has plants and keeps them alive. I wanted to be that person.

I am clearly not that person.

You were a pothos. Pothos are, by all accounts, the most forgiving plants available. They survive in low light. They survive without water. They survive in conditions described, in the plant guides I read too late, as "almost impossible to kill."

I found a way.

I am sorry. Not because I believe you suffered — I don't know enough about plant consciousness to make that claim — but because you were supposed to be alive and you are not, and that outcome is mine.

**To the letter I drafted but didn't send**

You were honest. This is the problem.

I wrote you because I had a thing to say that I'd been not-saying for a long time, and the not-saying had become its own kind of problem, and I decided — correctly, I still think — that the thing should be said.

I wrote you in one sitting, which I have read is a good sign. I left you overnight. In the morning I reread you and decided the honesty was excessive, or untimely, or addressed to the wrong person, or all three. I deleted you.

The thing I didn't say remains unsaid. I'm not sure whether you being unsent is better or worse than the thing remaining unsaid. I have not been able to determine this.

I am sorry for writing you with such intention and then using that intention as a reason not to send you.

**To the journal I kept for three weeks in 2007**

You contain eighteen entries. The first seven are substantial — observations about a city I was visiting, a thing someone said, a question I was trying to work out. By entry twelve you are mostly lists. Entry seventeen is one sentence. Entry eighteen says "tomorrow."

Tomorrow never arrived, journal-wise.

I found you last year in a box. I read you in one sitting. The person in you is not me exactly — they use certain phrases I no longer use, they care about certain things I've stopped caring about, they are anxious about things that resolved themselves without any effort on their part.

I am glad you exist. I am sorry I abandoned you. I am more glad than sorry.

**To the photograph I never printed**

You are on a hard drive that I can no longer locate. You are a good photograph. You were taken in a specific light — late afternoon, coming through a window at an angle — and it caught something I can still describe: a person I cared about, looking at something outside the frame, not knowing they were being photographed. The thing outside the frame made them look, briefly, like themselves in a way that people usually aren't when they know they're being looked at.

I took you on a phone I no longer have. I backed up that phone to a computer I no longer have. I may have transferred you to the hard drive I can no longer locate. I may not have.

If you still exist, you are very small — a few megabytes on a drive in a box in a storage unit or a closet. You are not visible to anyone. You are preserving the light as it was, at that angle, on that afternoon, which is your whole function, and you are performing it invisibly.

Thank you. I'm sorry.
