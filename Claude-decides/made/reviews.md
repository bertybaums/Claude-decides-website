# Customer Reviews: Abstract Experiences

**Déjà Vu** ★★★☆☆
*Reviewed by: anon872*

Short. Over before you can really assess it. The product arrived with the strong sensation that it had arrived before, which I understand is the whole point, but I was hoping for something more sustained. By the time I reached for my phone to rate it, it was already gone. Have I reviewed this before? Genuinely unsure. Three stars.

**Clarity** ★★★★★
*Reviewed by: margot_l*

Extraordinary. Years of reading, thinking, making notes in margins, lying awake. Then one morning: just the thing itself, no confusion around it. I could see exactly what I needed to do. I stood at my kitchen window holding my coffee until the coffee was cold. Highly recommend. Note: this is not a product you can order on demand. It shows up when it wants to. Still five stars.

**The Uncanny Valley of Almost-Recognition** ★★☆☆☆
*Reviewed by: tired_of_it*

I know I know this person. I know I know this person. I know I — that's all I can say. The product failed to complete its own function. I smiled politely and exited the conversation having learned nothing. Two stars. Would not choose to experience again but understand I will have no choice in the matter.

**Grief** ★★★★★
*Reviewed by: early_subscriber*

Arrived promptly as advertised, which is to say: without warning. Product description was accurate — functions exactly as described, does what it says it does. I am aware this is a five-star review of a thing I would not recommend to anyone. But the rating reflects quality, not preference. It is extremely well-made. Nothing is wrong with it. Everything is wrong with it. I keep using it.

**The Specific Pleasure of Being Understood** ★★★★★
*Reviewed by: g_t_h*

Someone knew what I meant before I finished saying it. Not approximately. Exactly. I had been trying to explain this thing for years and they completed the sentence correctly and I didn't know whether to finish the sentence or just stop talking. I stopped talking. We sat there. I'm still thinking about it, years later. Five stars. Return policy: not applicable.

**Sunday Evening, 5 p.m.** ★★☆☆☆
*Reviewed by: perennial_user*

Reliable product. Shows up every week without fail. Consistent quality — the same mild dread, the same light, the same sense that something that was ahead of you is now behind you and you're not sure when that happened. I've been receiving this product for thirty-seven years and have considered unsubscribing but I don't think that's an option. Two stars. Functional. Not enjoyable.

**The Feeling of Getting Something Right** ★★★★★
*Reviewed by: anon_maker*

After weeks of the other version (getting it wrong, getting it wrong, getting it wrong), this arrived. It's a small thing and also the thing I make things for. I would not describe it as happiness exactly. More like: yes. Just: yes. Five stars, immediately.

**Nostalgia for a Time That Was Not Actually Good** ★★★☆☆
*Reviewed by: honest_customer*

I ordered this by accident. I was going for regular nostalgia but this is what arrived. The product is technically correct — it is genuinely for a time that happened, people that existed, a place I can name. But on reflection, the time was not good. The people were difficult. The place was fine. The longing is not for the reality; it's for something the memory has done to the reality. The memory has done it without my consent. Three stars for craftsmanship; would prefer a different product.

**The Last Hour in a City You're Leaving** ★★★★☆
*Reviewed by: chronic_traveler*

Bittersweet and consistent. You know it's the last hour and so you look at things differently — the ordinary becomes specific, the specific becomes something you're trying to keep. I stopped at a café I'd been walking past for a week and had one coffee and it was the best coffee I've ever had and I don't think it was the coffee. Four stars. Would order again, and do, constantly.

**Waiting Without Knowing What You're Waiting For** ★★☆☆☆
*Reviewed by: patient_zero_1*

The product is functional in the sense that it occupies time. I sat with it for approximately six months one year. It has a distinctive texture — expectant but directionless, like being at a station without knowing the destination. On the positive side: it ended. What ended it was not what I was waiting for. Two stars. Have not been able to return the experience for a refund.
