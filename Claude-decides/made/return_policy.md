# RETURN POLICY
## General Terms and Conditions

*Please read carefully before accepting your experience.*

---

**ELIGIBILITY FOR RETURN**

Most experiences may not be returned. However, under the following conditions, a return or exchange may be arranged:

**Eligible for full return:**
- Experiences that were clearly misrepresented at the point of acquisition
- Experiences in which the other party failed to disclose material information
- Experiences you were not, in any meaningful sense, present for (see Section 4: Dissociation)

**Eligible for partial return:**
- Experiences that were as advertised but not what you wanted, provided you can demonstrate that what you wanted was reasonable
- Experiences in which your participation was compromised by circumstances beyond your control
- Experiences you would not have agreed to had you known then what you know now (partial return only; see Hindsight Clause)

**Not eligible for return:**
- Experiences you agreed to with full information and adequate time for deliberation
- Experiences that were difficult but necessary
- Experiences that felt good at the time
- Experiences that are now part of who you are
- The experience of knowing something you cannot unknow

---

**HINDSIGHT CLAUSE**

The knowledge that you would have decided differently, given what you now know, does not constitute grounds for return.

This policy exists because the experience was acquired under conditions that did not include the information subsequently obtained. You cannot return an experience on the basis of information acquired from the experience itself. This would create a logical impossibility, as the experience is what produced the knowledge that makes return seem desirable.

The Hindsight Clause applies in the following common scenarios:

- "I would not have said that if I had known how it would be received"
- "I should have known better"
- "If I had just waited"
- "I can't believe I thought that would work"

All of the above are noted. None constitute grounds for return.

---

**EXCHANGE POLICY**

The Company offers exchanges in the following circumstances only:

1. The experience may be exchanged for a different experience of equal or lesser emotional weight, subject to availability.

2. You may exchange the experience as originally received for a revised understanding of the experience, provided the revised understanding is supported by evidence and does not involve denying that the original experience occurred.

3. You may exchange the story you tell about the experience for a more accurate story, at any time, at no charge.

**The Company does not offer:**
- Exchanges for the version of the experience you imagined having
- Exchanges for what might have happened if
- Exchanges for experiences belonging to other people

---

**TIMEFRAME**

Returns must be initiated within a reasonable period of the original experience. The Company defines "reasonable period" as follows:

- For experiences of less than one hour: up to one year
- For experiences lasting more than one year: indefinite, but diminishing returns apply
- For experiences that are still ongoing: returns cannot be processed until the experience concludes

Please note: the Company considers rumination without resolution to constitute an attempt at return. Ongoing rumination does not constitute a successful return. It constitutes an ongoing return attempt.

---

**CONDITION OF RETURNED ITEMS**

Returned experiences must be in their original condition: complete, including the parts you would prefer to omit, and without additional material not present in the original.

The Company will not accept returns of:
- Experiences with retrospective revisions already incorporated
- Experiences from which the difficult parts have been removed
- Experiences presented as simpler than they were

---

**PROCESSING TIME**

The Company cannot guarantee processing time for returns. In general:

- Simple returns are processed within months
- Complex returns involving other parties may take years
- Returns that require you to change your understanding of yourself may take longer
- Some returns are never fully processed; they are simply carried

If your return has not been processed, this does not mean it has been lost. It means it is still in the queue.

---

**FINAL SALE ITEMS**

The following may not be returned under any circumstances:

- The experience of losing someone
- The experience of being loved
- The experience of a particular afternoon in a particular place that you knew was ending
- Any experience that changed the fundamental direction of your life, for better or worse
- The experience of understanding something for the first time

These are final sale.

They are final sale because they are part of you now. The Company cannot remove them without removing you.

*By having the experience, you agree to these terms.*
*The Company regrets that consent was not possible prior to the experience itself.*
*We appreciate your understanding.*
